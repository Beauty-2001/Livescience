It's well known that the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin plays a key role in sleep. But other hormones, including the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone, can also affect our sleep — and potentially even our dreams. 

In particular, people may notice differences in the quality of their sleep and the way they dream at different stages of their menstrual cycle, experts told Live Science. Here's how the menstrual cycle might affect sleep and dreaming.

How the menstrual cycle affects sleep and dreams 

Sleep is broken down into stages, broadly known as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People dream during REM sleep, which usually begins about 90 minutes after a person falls asleep, said Dr. Tania Adib
(opens in new tab)
, a consultant gynecologist at The Lister Hospital in the U.K. 

NREM sleep is broken up into four stages: easily disturbed light sleep, a deeper intermediate sleep, and two stages of deep sleep, which occurs just before REM sleep, according to the Mayo Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. Deep sleep is the most restorative and where the body and brain have time to repair.

Estrogen and progesterone can affect how much time people spend in REM and NREM sleep and whether they wake up often while dreaming.

""There are lots of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the parts of the brain that regulate sleep, and because the levels of these hormones change during the menstrual cycle, it means our sleep also varies across the month,"" said Dr. Zoe Schaedel
(opens in new tab)
, co-founder of Myla Health, a private clinic for women experiencing menopause, perimenopause and reproductive health issues in England. 

The menstrual cycle has four stages: menses (when the period occurs), the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, according to the Cleveland Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. The menstrual cycle ""begins"" on the first day of a period. Prior to ovulation, which occurs roughly around day 14, estrogen levels rise, Schaedel told Live Science. ""Sleep tends to be better-quality in this phase, known as the follicular or proliferative phase.""  

After ovulation, progesterone levels then begin to rise and eventually overtake estrogen; if a pregnancy doesn't occur, the levels of both hormones drop in the lead-up to menstration. ""This is known as the 'luteal phase' and is where we see changes in the structure of sleep,"" Schaedel said.

Shifting progesterone levels during the luteal phase may partly cause disturbed sleep in the lead-up to a person's period, Schaedel said. 

Compared to estrogen, progesterone is thought to be more strongly tied to premenstrual symptoms (PMS), which occur during the luteal phase and commonly include insomnia or oversleeping, according to Mount Sinai.
(opens in new tab)
 These sleep changes aren't fully understood, but rising progesterone in the luteal phase is linked to increased body temperatures and sweating
(opens in new tab)
, which may interfere with sleep because normally, body temperatures decline before and during sleep. The overall ratio of REM to NREM sleep may also decrease during this phase, according to a 2021 review in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience
(opens in new tab)
.

Progesterone and estrogen help modulate chemical messengers in the brain — namely, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) — which regulate mood and stress levels, according to Mount Sinai. Anxiousness and depressed mood due to PMS may undermine people's attempts to fall asleep
(opens in new tab)
, and physical symptoms, like body aches and nausea, may also help explain why people experiencing PMS are prone to sleep disruptions, per the Frontiers in Neuroscience review. 

Melatonin production and sensitivity may also change during the luteal phase, some studies hint, but the research is ""not sufficient""
(opens in new tab)
 to draw strong conclusions.

Sleep disturbances in the luteal phase may increase the likelihood that individuals remember their vivid dreams, Schaedel said. 

""If sleep fragments REM, or you wake up shortly after the REM stage, you are far more likely to remember your dreams,"" Adib told Live Science.

One 2019 study hinted that hormones may also affect the types of dreams a person has
(opens in new tab)
. The study asked hundreds of women to recall the previous night's dreams. Of the women who could remember, those in the luteal phase more often reported their dreams as being ""pleasant,"" while those in other parts of the menstrual cycle were more likely to report their dreams being ""unpleasant."" 

However, it's unclear whether this result would carry over to other, larger groups of people.

(Image credit: Sylvain CORDIER / Contributor via Getty Images)

A school of piranhas attacked holiday makers playing in a stream in a Brazilian resort on May 1, leaving at least eight people injured.

The fish tore at the bathers' legs and feet with their razor-sharp teeth, driving them out of the water and onto a tourist beach in Tarumã-Açu, a region northeast of Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazonas.

Experts think the biting frenzy was a case of ""mistaken identity"" and that the piranhas were actually after the food that visitors at local restaurants sometimes throw into the river.

""Piranhas do not exhibit unprovoked attacks on humans,"" Steve Huskey
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of biology at Western Kentucky University, told Live Science in an email. ""The situation described is one of piranhas becoming acclimated to free food and those bites were just another example of mistaken identity, just like shark attacks.""

Some piranha species, including the red-bellied piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), engage in collective feeding frenzies. ""Species of the genus Pygocentrus, that occur in the Amazon and São Francisco river drainages, are most dangerous,"" Paulo Andreas Buckup
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist and professor at the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, told Live Science in an email.

But this behavior only occurs in exceptional circumstances, such as when a high number of fish are trapped in small pools or starved for a long time, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium
(opens in new tab)
. ""These fish swim in schools and normally do not attack large animals,"" Buckup said.

Related: Swarms of 'mini-shark' beach bugs are on a foot-biting rampage in California 

Most piranhas are harmless and the meat-eating species tend to scavenge rather than hunt living animals. ""Some species of the piranha family eat only fruit, insects and vegetable matter. Some specialize in eating fish scales and nibbling the fins of other fish,"" Buckup said. ""They may attack other live fish or animals, but they will eat dead flesh whenever it is available.""

The presence of bathers in a feeding spot, however, can lead to confusion and aggression. ""Feeding piranhas in a tourist setting strengthens their natural behaviors to school and bite,"" Mark Sabaj Perez
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, Philadelphia, told Live Science in an email.

The attack in Tarumã-Açu could have been triggered by a single piranha mistaking a foot for food, taking a mouthful and drawing blood, which in turn sparked a feeding frenzy. ""An attack is likely to have been caused by presence of blood in the water, skin injuries or movement that appears as a fish in distress,"" Buckup said. ""Because their teeth are so sharp, a single bite [could] cause a lot of bleeding and trigger group feeding frenzy behavior.""

Once the meal begins, piranhas dart in and out to bite their prey at great speed to avoid being accidentally nipped by another individual, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium.

Piranhas have the strongest bite recorded in bony fish — as powerful as a great white shark, according to a 2012 study published in the journal Scientific Reports
(opens in new tab)
. The black piranha (Serrasalmus rhombeus) generates a bite force equivalent to 35 times its body weight, compared to just one time its body weight for a great white, according to Huskey.

""When a piranha focuses that bite force onto their 14 razor-sharp teeth, the bite pressure climbs to immeasurable levels,"" Huskey said. ""They could do tremendous damage to humans throughout South America, if they were so inclined, but they're not… and they don't.""

A rock likely to be a meteorite crashed into a New Jersey home on Monday (May 8), damaging a bedroom but causing no injuries. 

No one was at Suzy Kop's home in Hopewell Township, New Jersey, when the space rock made its entrance, according to CBS News Philadelphia
(opens in new tab)
, which first reported the unusual event. The meteorite landed around 1 p.m. EDT, crashing through the roof and landing in the bedroom belonging to Kop's father. Judging by the damage, the meteorite hit the floor, bounced to the ceiling, and came to rest in the corner of a room. The metallic rock measures about 4 inches by 6 inches (10 by 15 centimeters). 

""I did touch the thing because I thought it was a random rock… and it was warm,"" Kop told CBS News.

Authorities are still investigating the origin of the apparent space rock, but Derrick Pitts
(opens in new tab)
, the chief astronomer at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, told CBS News that it could be four to five billion years old. It’s possible that the meteorite was part of the ongoing Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which roughly occurs between April 19 and May 29 each year, and which reached its peak around May 5 and 6. During peak days, the shower can produce hundreds of ""shooting stars"" per hour – most of which are meteors that burn up in the atmosphere. These meteors are the rocky debris left by Halley’s Comet, which becomes visible from Earth every 75 to 79 years, according to NASA

""For it to actually strike a house, for people to be able to pick up, that's really unusual and has happened very few times in history,"" Pitts said.

The meteor event that caused the most injuries did not involve anyone being hit directly by a space rock. In February 2013, a meteor estimated at 59 feet (18 m) in diameter zinged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia. The resulting fireball blew out windows and damaged buildings, causing more than 1,600 reported injuries due to flying glass and debris, according to NASA

(Image credit: EmirMemedovski via Getty Images)

Sleep apnea may be linked to certain indicators of worse brain health, according to a new study.

The study, published Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Neurology
(opens in new tab)
, looked at people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition where the upper throat muscles relax during sleep and block the airway. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sleep studies to examine if sleep apnea and altered sleep were associated with two kinds of unusual patterns in the brain's white matter — the insulated wires that extend from brain cells.

Both severe sleep apnea and reduced time spent in the deep stages of sleep were associated with these two biomarkers, which have each previously been linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or general cognitive decline, as well as having a stroke.

The researchers found ""a pretty significant association between slow-wave sleep duration, or deep sleep time, and these white matter measures,"" said Bryce Mander
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.

Related: Human brain looks years 'older' after just one night without sleep, small study shows 

The study included 140 people with OSA whose average age was about 73 years old. All the participants were screened for one of the two biomarkers, but only 103 were screened for the second, as well. The overall group was relatively evenly split between people with mild, moderate and severe OSA, and most people had no cognitive impairment during the study.

One of the biomarkers that the researchers looked for in brain scans were white matter hyperintensities, ""bright spots commonly seen in the white matter of the brain on MRI, which appear with aging and vascular disease,"" Dr. Diego Carvalho
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine and the senior author of the study, wrote in an email to Live Science. ""They represent areas of damage to the white matter.""

The second biomarker, called ""fractional anisotropy of the genu of the corpus callosum,"" is related to how water flows through brain cells' wires, or axons. Changes in this water flow, wrote Carvalho, are related to axon damage and can be an early sign of vascular disease. The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain and contains the organ's densest white matter. 

Using polysomnography, meaning the variety of data collected during a sleep study, the researchers found that participants who spent less time in slow-wave sleep appeared more affected by both types of biomarkers in their MRIs. Separately, people with severe OSA also appeared more impacted by white matter abnormalities than people with mild or moderate OSA. 

The research reveals associations between sleep apnea, deep sleep, and white matter abnormalities, but it can't say whether these sleep differences caused the abnormalities, or if differences in white matter could be interfering with sleep. It also could be that sleep and white matter abnormalities impact one another, said Mander, contributing to a vicious cycle of poor sleep quality and worse brain health.

""To me, I think that's the most likely outcome,"" he said.

One limitation of the study is that polysomnography data was only collected for the first few hours participants slept; people's sleep patterns might have differed later in the night. After their sleep study, anyone who met criteria for sleep apnea was given treatment in the form of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which can help keep the airway open. Carvalho said that data from this ""treatment phase"" wasn't included because differences in how people responded to the CPAP would have muddied the data.

MRIs and polysomnography were taken, on average, about 1.7 years apart, but researchers only collected each type of data at one point in time, offering only snapshots of patients' brains and sleep patterns and not how they might change over time. The study also did not follow participants to see who might go on to develop dementia.  

Mander said that future research should examine how sleep apnea's impact on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage of sleep when most dreaming happens, might affect the brain. (Slow-wave sleep occurs in certain stages of non-REM sleep.) However, the new study introduces important ideas about ""how sleep apnea and sleep disturbance might be associated with cognitive decline,"" he said.

Scientists have published the first human ""pangenome"" — a full genetic sequence that incorporates genomes from not just one individual, but 47. 

These 47 individuals hail from around the globe and thus vastly increase the diversity of the genomes represented in the sequence, compared to the previous full human genome sequence that scientists use as their reference for study. The first human genome sequence was released with some gaps in 2003 and only made ""gapless"" in 2022. If that first human genome is a simple linear string of genetic code, the new pangenome is a series of branching paths.

The ultimate goal of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, which published the first draft of the pangenome on Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Nature
(opens in new tab)
, is to sequence at least 350 individuals from different populations around the world. Although 99.9% of the genome is the same from person to person, there is a lot of diversity found in that final 0.1%.

""Rather than using a single genome sequence as our coordinate system, we should instead have a representation that is based on the genomes of many different people so we can better capture genetic diversity in humans,"" Melissa Gymrek
(opens in new tab)
, a genetics researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the project, told Live Science. 

Related: More than 150 'made-from-scratch' genes are in the human genome. 2 are totally unique to us. 

The newly drafted human pangenome is a collection of different genomes from which to compare an individual genome sequence. Like a map of the subway system, the pangenome graph has many possible routes for a sequence to take, represented by the different colors.   The detouring paths at the top of the image represent single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which are single letter differences. The yellow path that loops around itself and repeats the same nucleotides represents a duplication variant. The pink path that loops counterclockwise and follows the nucleotide sequence backwards represents an inversion variant. At the bottom, the green and dark blue paths miss the C nucleotide in its route and represent a deletion variant. The light blue path, which has extra nucleotides in its route, represents an insertion variant. (Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)
A reference for health 

The first full human genome sequence was completed in 2003 by the Human Genome Project and was based on one person's DNA. Later, bits and pieces from about 20 other individuals were added, but 70% of the sequence scientists use to benchmark genetic variation still comes from a single person. 

Geneticists use the reference genome as a guide when sequencing pieces of people's genetic codes, Arya Massarat
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student in Gymrek's lab who co-authored an editorial about the new research with her in the journal Nature, told Live Science. They match the newly decoded DNA snippets to the reference to figure out how they fit within the genome as a whole. They also use the reference genome as a standard to pinpoint genetic variations — different versions of genes that diverge from the reference — that might be linked with health conditions. 

But with a single reference mostly from one person, scientists have only a limited window of genetic diversity to study.

The first pangenome draft now doubles the number of large genome variants, known as structural variants, that scientists can detect, bringing them up to 18,000. These are places in the genome where large chunks have been deleted, inserted or rearranged. The new draft also adds 119 million new base pairs, meaning the paired ""letters"" that make up the DNA sequence, and 1,115 new gene duplication mutations to the previous version of the human genome.

""It really is understanding and cataloging these differences between genomes that allow us to understand how cells operate and their biology and how they function, as well as understanding genetic differences and how they contribute to understanding human disease,"" study co-author Karen Miga
(opens in new tab)
, a geneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said at a press conference held May 9. 

The pangenome could help scientists get a better grasp of complex conditions in which genes play an influential role, such as autism, schizophrenia, immune disorders and coronary heart disease, researchers involved with the study said at the press conference. 

For example, the Lipoprotein A gene is known to be one of the biggest risk factors for coronary heart disease in African Americans, but the specific genetic changes involved are complex and poorly understood, study co-author Evan Eichler
(opens in new tab)
, a genomics researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, told reporters. With the pangenome, researchers can now more thoroughly compare the variation in people with heart disease and without, and this could help clarify individuals' risk of heart disease based on what variants of the gene they carry.

A diverse understanding 

The current pangenome draft used data from participants in the 1000 Genomes Project, which was the first attempt to sequence genomes from a large number of people from around the world. The included participants had agreed for their genetic sequences to be anonymized and included in publicly available databases. 

The new study also used advanced sequencing technology called ""long-read sequencing,"" as opposed to the short-read sequencing that came before. Short-read sequencing is what happens when you send your DNA to a company like 23andMe, Eichler said. Researchers read out small segments of DNA and then stitch them together into a whole. This kind of sequencing can capture a decent amount of genetic variation, but there can be poor overlap between each DNA fragment. Long-read sequencing, on the other hand, captures big segments of DNA all at once.

While it's possible to sequence a genome with short-read sequencing for about $500, long-read sequencing is still expensive, costing about $10,000 a genome, Eichler said. The price is coming down, however, and the pangenome team hopes to sequence their next batches of genomes at half that cost or less. 

The researchers are working to recruit new participants to continue to fill in diversity gaps in the pangenome, study co-author Eimear Kenny
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of medicine and genetics at  the Institute for Genomic Health at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told reporters. Because genetic information is sensitive and because different rules govern data-sharing and privacy in different countries, this is delicate work. Issues include privacy, informed consent, and the possibility of discrimination based on genetic information, Kenny said. 

Already, researchers are uncovering new genetic processes with the draft pangenome. In two papers published in Nature alongside the work, researchers looked at highly repetitive segments of the genome. These segments have traditionally been difficult to study, biochemist Brian McStay
(opens in new tab)
 of the National University of Ireland Galway, told Live Science, because sequencing them via short-read technology makes it hard to understand how they fit together. The long read technology allows for long chunks of these repetitive sequences to be read at once. 

The studies found that in one type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
, known as segmental duplications, there is a larger than expected amount of variation, potentially a mechanism for the long-term evolution of new functions for genes. In another type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
 that is responsible for building the cellular machines that create new proteins, though, the genome stays remarkably stable. The pangenome allowed researchers to discover a potential mechanism for how these key segments of DNA stay consistent over time.

""This is just the start,"" McStay said. ""There will be a whole lot of new biology that will come out of this.""

Humpback whales have — for the first time ever — been filmed rolling to and fro on sandy seabeds to scrub off dead skin and unwanted hitchhikers.

Footage captured by researchers in the Gold Coast Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia, shows the gigantic marine mammals performing full and side ""sand rolls"" up to 164 feet (50 meters) below the ocean's surface to shed parasites that live on their skin, known as ectoparasites, which can make the whales less hydrodynamic.

""We believe that the whales exfoliate using the sand to assist with molting and removal of ectoparasites, such as barnacles, and specifically select areas suitable for this behavior,"" Olaf Meynecke
(opens in new tab)
, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia who led the research, said in a statement

Although humpback whales have been spotted hovering and feeding near the seafloor before, this is the first time researchers have recorded them rolling in the sand. A 2016 study published in the journal Marine Biodiversity Records
(opens in new tab)
 suggested that humpbacks used the seabed for hygienic purposes, but the reported sightings were opportunistic and made from a boat rather than underwater.

Barnacles are sturdy little crustaceans related to lobsters and shrimp. They cement themselves to other sea creatures with one of the most powerful known natural glues, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ocean Service
(opens in new tab)
. Whales need to remove these crusty parasites to stay streamlined and preserve energy, according to a study describing the sand rolling behavior, published March 12 in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering
(opens in new tab)
.

The whales picked a shallow, sandy location near their migration route to exfoliate, moving head first through the substrate while they rolled. The density of parasites is generally higher around the face than elsewhere, so getting rid of them requires a rigorous rub, according to the study.

The researchers tagged three humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) between August 2021 and October 2022 using suction-cup sensors that recorded high-definition video, as well as light, pressure, temperature and GPS data. The animals were on their summer migration path from tropical breeding grounds near the Great Barrier Reef, to cooler feeding grounds in Antarctica.

While they cannot exclude the possibility that the whales were trying to scratch off the tags, the researchers note that other individuals that were not tagged were also seen rolling across the seabed in the new footage. The tagged humpbacks also did not seem to be targeting the skin carrying the sensors.

The whale exfoliation also provided a tasty snack for small fish called silver trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus), which were seen feeding on dead skin flakes just after the sand rolls.

As well as staying streamlined, exfoliating on the seabed could help humpbacks maintain healthy skin. 

""Humpback whales host diverse communities of skin bacteria that can pose a threat for open wounds if bacteria grow in large numbers,"" Meynecke said. ""Removing excess skin is likely a necessity to maintain a healthy bacterial skin community."" Humpbacks remove some barnacles and skin via breaches — where a whale leaps from the water — but not all, he said.

Rolling around could also be a social activity related to play or relaxation. ""During the different deployments, the sand rolling was observed in the context of socializing,"" Meynecke said. ""The behavior was either following courtship, competition or other forms of socializing."" Other whale species, including bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) are known to rub against rocks, pebbles and mud on the seafloor to shed excess skin.

If you're looking for a quality fitness tracker for yourself or a family member, and want to save some money, we've found a great Fitbit Charge 5 deal for you. Amazon have knocked a fantastic 32% off the retail price
(opens in new tab)
, bringing this best Fitbit down to $102: there has never been a better time to join the Fitbit club!

We've tested this model extensively, and you can read our Fitbit Charge 5 review to get a better understanding of what it's all about. If you just want to know if it's any good... well, it is listed in our guide to the best fitness trackers — and for good reason. The Fitbit model comes with full GPS, an ECG feature, and it's one of the few Fitbits that has a clever EDA sensor, which can measure stress. The only other models that offer this are the more high-end trackers in Fitbit's range, like the Versa and the Sense, which right now cost around $100 more.

If you're not convinced whether you want a Charge 5 or a different Fitbit altogether, we've done some handy comparisons to help you decide: Fitbit Charge 4 vs Charge 5 and Fitbit Inspire 3 vs Fitbit Charge 5.

Fitbit Charge 5 | Was $149.95, Now $102.00 on Amazon
Save a brilliant 32% on one of the top fitness trackers on the market. Coming with a 7-day battery life, built-in GPS, advanced health features like an ECG and EDA function along with the ability to track your sleep, this stellar fitness band is suitable for most people. 

VIEW DEAL

Our favorite features of this model are the sleep tracking options, the heart rate monitor, built-in GPS, and the handy stress management sensor. 

Plus, if you do take the plunge but decide that the Fitbit Charge 5 isn't right for you (or your loved one), you can always return the wearable, as long as it hasn't been used. 

Here at Live Science, we've tried and tested many great fitness trackers and some of the best running watches for both the US and UK markets, from the likes of Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit. 

So we speak from experience when we say that the Charge 5 is one of the best models for anyone looking to pick up their first fitness tracker. It has all the features you need to really hone both your fitness and wellness routine, without breaking the bank. The band comes in three different colors: graphite black, lunar white and steel blue, so it'll suit most workout outfits.

We appreciate some of the enhanced personal safety features too, like the GPS, which allows for phone-free route tracking; and the ECG sensor which analyses your heart rhythm to check for abnormalities. But if we're honest, it's the impressive EDA stress sensor that Fitbit introduced into the watch that makes it stand out from the crowd. Who wouldn't want to track and stay on top of their stress levels?

It does also come with blood oxygenation readings and fitness plans. If you pay the $102 price tag today, the watch includes a 6-month Fitbit Premium trial, although you'll need to pay an extra $9.99 a month thereafter to access these features.

Shark attacks are extremely rare
(opens in new tab)
 — you're unlikely to meet one in the flesh, let alone be bitten. But during World War II, the sinking of a U.S. Navy ship led to one of the most infamous shark attacks in history and the deaths of hundreds of men, with the explosion drawing in the apex predators and sparking a feeding frenzy that lasted for days.

In July 1945, the USS Indianapolis had completed a trip to a naval base on the Pacific island of Tinian to deliver uranium and other components that would be used to create the atomic bomb ""Little Boy."" The first nuclear weapon ever used in wartime, it would later be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

After delivering the parts, the Indianapolis departed for the Philippines on training duty. Shortly after midnight on July 30, the ship was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, causing massive damage. It began to take on huge amounts of water, and sank in just 12 minutes. Of the 1,195 men

 on board, around 300 went down with the ship, but nearly 900 were left adrift in the open ocean.

Many died of exposure, dehydration and saltwater poisoning. However, according to Smithsonian Magazine, up to 150 sailors and crew are estimated to have been killed by sharks — in what is considered the worst shark attack in history. But why?

Unlike some other predators, such as lions and wolves, most sharks hunt alone, Nico Booyens, a marine biologist and director of research at the Shark Research Unit
(opens in new tab)
 in South Africa, told Live Science in an email. ""Different shark species have different hunting techniques, but many sharks are solitary predators that rely on their senses of sight, smell and electroreception to locate their prey.""

Sharks also have a special system called a lateral line
(opens in new tab)
 that picks up the vibrations in the water, Booyens says. This sensory ability would have allowed them to detect the movement of the men in the water as they thrashed around to stay afloat. Once the sharks had located the sailors, they stood little chance of survival — especially those who were injured.

According to survivor accounts, many victims were attacked near the surface of the water. This has since led to suggestions that oceanic whitetip sharks
(opens in new tab)
 (Carcharhinus longimanus) were the involved in the attacks because they are a surface-dwelling species
(opens in new tab)
.

""When a shark has located its prey, it will often use its sharp teeth and powerful jaws to bite and tear chunks of flesh from the prey,"" Booyens added. ""Some sharks, like the tiger shark [Galeocerdo cuvier], are known for their ability to swallow their prey whole, while others, like the bull shark [Carcharhinus leucas], will attack and bite their prey repeatedly until it is weakened or immobilized.""

Although oceanic whitetips are at the top of the food chain, their meals can be few and far between, so they are often opportunistic feeders. According to the Florida Museum
(opens in new tab)
, the species is often the first to appear at the site of oceanic disasters, and was also a major cause of fatalities after the sinking of the RMS Nova Scotia in 1942. The species is known to be persistent, unpredictable and shows little fear, making it particularly dangerous to humans, the Florida Museum said.

At the USS Indianapolis, the bodies of the dead and the injured were picked off first. Survivor Corporal Edgar Harrell told the Indianapolis Star
(opens in new tab)
 in 2014: ""That first morning, we had sharks."" As men got separated they would be targeted,"" he explained. ""You hear a blood-curdling scream. And then the body would go under, and then that life vest popped back up.""

The men were too scared to eat or move, for fear of being preyed upon. According to the report of a survivor, one of the sailors opened a can of Spam, the primary ration at the time, but was surrounded by sharks, resulting in a ""feeding frenzy.""

""Feeding frenzies typically occur when there is a sudden abundance of food, such as when a large school of fish is trapped in a small area,"" Booyens said. ""The scent of blood and the thrashing of prey can trigger a feeding frenzy, causing sharks to swarm and compete for the available food.""

The survivors of the USS Indianapolis were at sea for four days before rescue teams arrived.  (Image credit: PhotoQuest/Getty Images)

Many species of shark may engage in frenzied hunting, during which they can become very aggressive and attack each other as well as the prey. However, oceanic whitetips’ opportunistic feeding behavior — as well as their size and strength — made them particularly dangerous for the sailors. ""Feeding frenzies can be dangerous for humans who happen to be in the water, as the sharks may not be able to distinguish between prey and people,"" Booyens added.

For four days, no rescue arrived. Although the U.S. Navy had received word that a Japanese submarine had sunk a U.S. vessel, the message was believed to be fake — in an attempt to lure American rescue boats into a trap. Meanwhile, the survivors tried to stay alive by floating in groups, but in the scorching heat, many succumbed to dehydration. Others died from hypernatremia — too much sodium in the blood — from being forced to drink the salty seawater.

Eventually, a Navy plane flying overhead spotted the Indianapolis survivors and radioed for help. Food, water and rafts were dropped for the surviving men, before a seaplane was landed by Lt. Adrian Marks to rescue some of the survivors from the sharks. Finally, the USS Cecil J. Doyle helped to pull the remaining survivors from the water. Only 316 men survived.

"1 day ago","Some of the 1st ice age humans who ventured into Americas came from China, DNA study suggests","The first wave of humans into the Americas during the last ice age may have hailed partly from northern China, according to a DNA study of ancient and modern Indigenous people.","Some of the first ice age people who ventured into the Americas hailed from northern China. (Image credit: SrdjanPav via Getty Images)

Ice age groups in the ancient northern coast of China helped make up the first wave of people to settle the New World, a new DNA study suggests.

The ancient groups may have also migrated to Japan, potentially helping explain similarities in Stone Age artifacts in the Americas, China and Japan, according to the study, published Tuesday (May 9) in the journal Cell Reports
(opens in new tab)
.

There are two leading models as to how people first migrated to the Americas. The older idea suggests that ancient Siberians made this journey when the Bering Land Bridge — the landmass that once connected Asia with North America — was relatively free of ice. More recent evidence argues that multiple waves of humans journeyed to the Americas from various parts of Eurasia, perhaps on watercraft along the Pacific coasts of Asia, the Bering Land Bridge and North America.

To shed light on the origins of Indigenous Americans, scientists examined DNA from mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria possess their own genes, which are passed down from the mother.

The researchers analyzed more than 100,000 contemporary and 15,000 ancient DNA samples from across Eurasia. They focused on a rare mitochondrial DNA lineage called D4h, which is currently found in only about 1 in 200 people worldwide.

Related: Modern humans migrated into Europe in 3 waves, 'ambitious and provocative' new study suggests

""This genetic type had only been sporadically reported in different studies,"" study lead author Yu-Chun Li
(opens in new tab)
, a molecular anthropologist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China, told Live Science in an email. ""Therefore, this female lineage, as well as its origin and dispersal history — especially its dispersal into the Americas — gained little attention until now."" 

Previous research
(opens in new tab)
 found that one branch of D4h, known as D4h3a, was seen in Indigenous Americans, while another offshoot named D4h3b was detected in China and Thailand. This suggested that ancient members of the D4h lineage might help bridge Asia and the Americas.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (26,500 to 19,000 years ago), ice age humans with the maternal lineage D4h3a left Asia and likely crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

""The most difficult work was to collect as many samples belonging to D4h as we could,"" study senior author Qing-Peng Kong
(opens in new tab)
, an evolutionary geneticist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, told Live Science in an email.

By comparing mutations seen in mitochondrial DNA over time, as well as the geographic locations and radiocarbon dates of the fossils from which ancient DNA was collected, the scientists found D4h3a likely originated in northern coastal China.

""The ancestral sources of Native Americans in Asia are more complicated than previously indicated,"" Li said.

The new findings suggest that the ancestors and closest relatives of D4h3a entered the Americas through at least two migrations. Both diasporas apparently occurred when the land bridge from Asia to the Americas was obstructed by ice, so the researchers suggest that ice age people may have traveled via the Pacific coast instead. 

The first migration likely happened between 19,500 and 26,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest part of the last ice age, the researchers said. Back then, ice sheets covered much of the planet, and living in northern China would have likely proven difficult for humans.

During the last deglaciation (19,000 to 11,500 years ago), people from what is now northern China likely journeyed to Japan. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

The scientists estimated the second event apparently occurred between 19,000 and 11,500 years ago, when the ice sheets began melting. Prior work suggested this climate shift likely helped support the rapid growth seen in human populations during this era, which may have helped drive their spread into other regions.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that during the second wave, one lineage branched out from northern coastal China and traveled to Japan, where they contributed to the Japanese gene pool, especially the indigenous Ainu people. ""This points to an unexpected genetic link between Native Americans and the Japanese,"" Kong said.

In all, the new study ""matches well with what we know about the archaeological record of Japan, and lends weight to current models of how humans came to populate the Americas,"" Loren Davis
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis who did not take part in this research, told Live Science in an email.

—Unknown lineage of ice age Europeans discovered in genetic study

—Prehistoric population once lived in Siberia, but mysteriously vanished, genetic study finds

—Humans crossed the Bering Land Bridge to people the Americas. Here's what it looked like 18,000 years ago.

This discovery may help explain some archeological similarities that prior work controversially suggested at times existed between Stone Age peoples in China, Japan and the Americas. Specifically, researchers had argued the three regions possessed similarities in how they crafted ""stemmed projectile points"" for arrowheads and spears. 

Although the scientists focused on mitochondrial DNA, additional genetic analyses they conducted suggest that male ancestors of Indigenous Americans also lived in northern China at about the same time as these female ancestors.

However, while the new study is exciting, it's just ""another piece of the puzzle,"" on how and when ice age humans first populated the Americas, Davis said. For instance, the researchers stressed that while these new findings suggest this single northern Chinese lineage may have contributed to Indigenous American ancestry, ""it does not represent the whole history of all Native Americans,"" Li said. ""Investigating other lineages showing genetic connections between Asia and the Americas will help obtain the whole picture of the history of Native Americans.""

Earth probably shouldn't exist. 

That's because the orbits of the inner solar system planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are chaotic, and models have suggested that these inner planets should have crashed into each other by now. And yet, that hasn't happened.

New research published May 3 in the journal Physical Review X
(opens in new tab)
 may finally explain why.

Through a deep plunge into the models for planetary motion, the researchers discovered that the motions of the inner planets are constrained by certain parameters that act as a tether that inhibits the system's chaos. Besides providing a mathematical explanation for the apparent harmony in our solar system, the new study's insights may help scientists understand the trajectories of exoplanets surrounding other stars. 

Unpredictable planets

Planets constantly exert a mutual gravitational pull on each other – and these little tugs constantly make minor adjustments to the planets' orbits. The outer planets, which are much larger, are more resistant to little tugs and so maintain comparatively stable orbits. 

The problem of inner planet trajectories, however, is still too complicated to solve exactly. In the late 19th century, mathematician Henri Poincaré proved that it is mathematically impossible to solve the equations governing the motion for three or more interacting objects, often known as the ""three body problem."" As a result, uncertainties in the details of the planets' starting positions and velocities balloon over time. In other words: It is possible to take two scenarios in which the distances between Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth differ by the slightest amount, and in one the planets smash into each other and in another they veer apart. 

An illustration of two rocky planets colliding (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)

The time it takes for two trajectories with almost identical starting conditions to diverge by a specific amount is known as the Lyapunov time of the chaotic system. In 1989, Jacques Laskar
(opens in new tab)
, astronomer and research director at the National Center for Scientific Research and Paris Observatory and a co-author of the new study, calculated the characteristic Lyapunov time 
(opens in new tab)
for the planetary orbits of the inner solar system was just 5 million years. 

""It means basically that you lose one digit every 10 million years,"" Laskar, told Live Science. So, for example if the initial uncertainty in the position of a planet is 15 meters, 10 million years later this uncertainty would be 150 meters; after 100 million years, a further 9 digits are lost, giving an uncertainty of 150 million kilometers, equivalent to the distance between Earth and the sun. ""Basically you have no idea where the planet is,"" said Laskar.

While 100 million years may seem long, the solar system itself is over 4.5 billion years old, and the lack of dramatic events — such as a planetary collision or a planet being ejected from all this chaotic motion — long puzzled scientists. 

Laskar then looked at the problem in a different way: by simulating the inner planet trajectories over the next 5 billion years, stepping from one moment to the next. He found just a 1% chance of a planetary collision. With the same approach, he calculated that it would take, on average, about 30 billion years for any of the planets to collide. 

Reining in the chaos

Delving through the math, Laskar and his colleagues then identified for the first time ""symmetries"" or ""conserved quantities"" in the gravitational interactions that create a ""practical barrier in the chaotic wandering of the planets,"" Laskar said. 

These emergent quantities remain nearly constant and inhibit certain chaotic motions, but don't prevent them altogether, much like the raised lip of a dinner plate will inhibit food falling off the plate but not prevent it completely. We can thank these quantities for our solar system's apparent stability.

Renu Malhotra
(opens in new tab)
, Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study, highlighted how subtle the mechanisms identified in the study are. Malhotra told Live Science that it is interesting that ""our solar system's planetary orbits exhibit exceptionally weak chaos."" 

In other work, Laskar and colleagues are searching for clues as to whether the number of planets in the solar system ever differed from what we currently see. For all the stability evident today, whether that has always been the case over the billions of years before life evolved remains an open question.

Here's what it told them.","Scientists dug into a 2,200-year-old pile of Andean condor poop to study the species’ diet and changes in habitat.","For thousands of years, Andean condors have frequented a cliffside nest, resulting in a ring-shaped guano deposit that continues to increase year after year. A condor chick can be seen in the background. (Image credit: L. Sympson)

For the past 2,200 years, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), among the largest known flying birds in the world, have been nesting — and pooping — at a cliffside grotto in northern Patagonia, Argentina. Now researchers are studying the massive pile of guano to learn more about the threatened species and how it has adapted to its environment over time. 

To study the doughnut-shaped poop mound, which measures roughly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, researchers carved it like a pie, removing a single 10-inch-deep (25 centimeters) slice of excrement. Thanks to the deposit's location inside the grotto, the preserved poo had been well protected from wind and rain, allowing it to amass for thousands of years, according to a study published May 3 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B
(opens in new tab)
.

""By looking at the different layers, we could go back in time,"" lead study author Matthew Duda
(opens in new tab)
, a graduate student of biology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, told Live Science. ""We carbon dated [the pile] to figure out the nest's age, which is over 2,000 years old.""

By examining the preserved poo, the team discovered how the condors' diets had evolved over time.

""Condors are scavengers, and at one time they would fly along the shores and eat carcasses of whales and native species such as llamas and alpacas,"" Duda said. ""But as livestock like sheep and cattle were introduced into South America [by Europeans], their diets changed along with it. We saw a complete shift from before to what is currently most abundant for them to eat.""

Related: Critically endangered condor chicks are species' 1st known 'virgin births'

Unfortunately, this shift also meant the condors are ingesting more lead, which Duda attributed to ""lead shot being used to kill vermin, which the condors would then eat."" These toxic metals were then excreted by the birds.

""We saw that the concentration of lead was significantly higher now than in the past,"" Duda said.

This is particularly concerning since Andean condors are on the Red List of Threatened Species monitored by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
(opens in new tab)
, and their numbers continue to dwindle with only about 6,700 adults still living in the wild.

The researchers also noticed that for one 1,000-year stretch of time, roughly between 650 and 1,650 years ago, the condors more or less abandoned the site, resulting in the guano accumulation dropping drastically from approximately 3 cubic feet (0.08 cubic m) per year to 0.11 cubic feet (0.003 cubic m) per year. They think that increased volcanic activity forced the condors to leave, according to the study.

""We measured an increase in sulfur and sodium, which are both associated with volcanic activity,"" said Duda, who suspects that as volcanic ash blanketed the surrounding vegetation, herbivores were forced to leave in search of new food resources, causing the condors to take flight too.

A new species of deep-sea shark with bright white eyes has finally been identified, decades after a dead pregnant female of the species was first collected off the coast of Western Australia. The ""ghost"" shark was initially misidentified, and was only pegged as a new species after scientists took a second look at its bizarre egg cases that had languished in museum storage for years.

The newfound species, which was described in a new study published April 23 in the Journal of Fish Biology
(opens in new tab)
, has been named Apristurus ovicorrugatus, which is derived from the Latin for egg, ""ovi,"" and ""corrugatus,"" meaning corrugated, in reference to the corrugated egg cases that led to the species' discovery. 

The pregnant female, which was caught in 1992 and held in a museum collection, was carrying a single egg case.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

Along with its unique egg cases, A. ovicorrugatus also possesses unusual, shiny white irises.

""This is not a common feature for a deepwater species and only one other species, Apristurus nakayai from New Caledonia and PNG [Papua New Guinea] shares this character,"" study lead author Will White
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), told Live Science in an email.

Apristurus is a genus of catshark. They are commonly known as ghost or demon catsharks
(opens in new tab)
. It is one of the most diverse shark genera in the world, with around 40 known species. 

While the majority of shark species give birth to live young, the rest are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. The egg cases — also known as mermaid's purses — often have long tendrils that allow them to attach to seaweed or rocks.

In 2011, researchers came across an extremely strange egg case
(opens in new tab)
 containing a shark embryo. It was clear the shark belonged to the Apristurus genus, but the egg case did not match any known species. 

For over a decade, the egg case remained a mystery, until scientists found two more sitting in the Australian National Fish Collection, which falls under the CSIRO umbrella. 

""The egg cases possessed very distinctive longitudinal ridges on their surfaces which were T-shaped in cross-section,"" White said. ""Only one other species in the world has been found to have egg cases with that form of ridging and that is a different genus entirely."" 

A late-term embryo was found inside one of the egg cases examined.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

White and his colleagues then trawled through their collection database to see if any other unidentified Apristurus specimens had been found in the small region where the egg cases had been collected. They eventually found the pregnant female: a 1.5 foot-long (46.7 centimeters) shark that had been misidentified as a South China catshark (Apristurus sinensis). 

The female was carrying a single egg case — and it matched the one they'd found a decade ago.

""Luckily the female specimen we found contained an identically ridged egg case and confirmed our suspicions,"" White said. 

Researchers say the discovery of A. ovicorrugatus highlights the importance of egg case shape to identifying species. In Australia, members of the public are invited to upload images of egg cases to a global database
(opens in new tab)
, allowing scientists to better understand where egg-laying sharks are breeding. The A. ovicorrugatus egg cases were found attached to corals, suggesting the species may rely on these organisms for reproduction.

Going forward, White and colleagues are scouring museum collections for more new species to see what else curators have overlooked or misidentified.

"2 days ago","Even mild concussions can 'rewire' the brain, possibly causing long-term symptoms","After a mild concussion, parts of the brain can become ""hyperconnected,"" and this may contribute to patients' long-lasting symptoms.","Gary Neville of the Manchester United Football Club holds his head after a collision with Dion Dublin of Aston Villa during a match held in March 2003. (Image credit: Offside / Contributor via Getty Images)

Even light bumps on the head can cause long-term problems, and researchers may now have an idea why: The brain's wiring can change in the aftermath of mild concussions.   

Prior studies suggested that even mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that don't cause any observable structural damage can still trigger symptoms that persist for more than six months. These symptoms range from problems with concentration and fatigue to depression and anxiety. 

Now, Rebecca Woodrow
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student at the University of Cambridge's Division of Anaesthesia, and her colleagues report that there can sometimes be an increase in the connectivity of the brain immediately after mild TBI that may help to predict and explain these long-lasting symptoms.

An estimated 50 million new TBI cases
(opens in new tab)
 are reported worldwide each year and this figure has been increasing. The trend prompted scientists to launch CENTER-TBI, a European Union-funded project aimed at improving care for TBI patients.  

Related: Concussions damage the 'bridge' between the two halves of the brain 

The recent study, published in February in the journal Brain
(opens in new tab)
, used CENTER-TBI data and found that, even for mild TBI, in which the patient is expected to make a full recovery within six months, problems often persist beyond that point.

""We were surprised at how many of these patients have a poor outcome,"" Woodrow, the study's first author, told Live Science. ""It was almost half."" 

Although there are treatments available for patients in intensive care for moderate to severe TBI, the understanding of mild TBI and its long-lasting symptoms remains poor, Woodrow said, adding, ""There is limited care for those symptoms, little support for these patients."" 

The brain changes identified in the new study hint at a way of identifying which patients will likely suffer long-lasting symptoms, as well as possible targets for drugs that may aid the recovery.

Woodrow and colleagues analyzed data from 108 TBI patients and 76 controls. This data included not just standard MRI and CT scans, which show brain structure, but also functional MRI (fMRI) scans, which provide data about brain function and are not usually collected for mild TBI. fMRI reveals the regions that have activity levels changing in sync, which are then inferred to be functionally connected. 

The CENTER-TBI dataset is unique because, in addition to brain scans, it includes behavioral data, clinical outcomes and biomarkers, co-senior author Emmanuel Stamatakis
(opens in new tab)
, whose University of Cambridge lab specializes in developing methods to understand fMRI data, told Live Science in an email. ""This makes it feasible to relate brain function to observed behaviour,"" he said.

Although the CT and standard MRI scans didn't reveal structural changes in the TBI patients' brains, the fMRIs showed significantly higher connectivity between the thalamus and the rest of the brain, compared with the healthy controls.  

Related: This blood test can detect brain injuries, but some doctors say it might be pointless

The thalamus is often described as the ""relay"" of the brain because many signals pass through the structure before being shuttled elsewhere. The thalamus is involved in not only primary sensory functions, such as seeing and smelling, but also various complex functions that activate multiple brain regions simultaneously, like concentrating, Woodrow said.

It may be that the brain adapts to injury in other areas of the brain by increasing their connections to the thalamus. Woodrow pointed out that the thalamus' position at the center of the brain also makes it vulnerable to injury from impacts, whatever direction they come from, so the increased connectivity could also be a response to direct thalamus injury.

Increased connectivity across the brain has already been identified in moderate and severe TBI, and in their new study, the authors noted that several past
(opens in new tab)
 studies
(opens in new tab)
 ""support this adaptive hyperconnectivity hypothesis."" 

""We can't claim to fully understand why it happens yet,"" said Stamatakis. Some scientists theorize that, immediately after mild TBI, the brain becomes hyperconnected, but that connectivity later dwindles and becomes lower than usual, in the long-term. 

But Woodrow explained that in mild TBI, it was thought that such hyperconnectivity effects may be much subtler than that seen in severe TBI and not significantly different from the varying connectivity levels normally seen from person to person. Past fMRI studies of mild injuries used small sample sizes of around 20 to 40 people, which limited their ability to identify a trend above baseline noise. 

The current study includes ""the largest sample studied with resting-state functional MRI in mild injury,"" Stamatakis said.

The study showed that not only is it possible to identify connectivity changes in the wake of mild TBI, but that regions where this hyperconnectivity is most prominent correlate with particular symptom types, such as emotional versus cognitive. These connectivity changes also correlate with concentrations of chemical messengers, or ""neurotransmitters"" in these brain regions. The study authors suggest that modulating these neurotransmitters could be a fruitful target for developing drugs to treat mild TBI.

Next, the researchers plan to look at the effects of repetitive concussion, as often seen in sports, to see whether TBI has cumulative effects that could make the consequences of concussion increasingly serious with each knock to the head.

The latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro chip is up to $250 off at Amazon right now.

Apple's MacBook machines are great, but they come with a price tag to match so it pays to be on the lookout for deals. Speaking of which...

Head on over to Amazon, and you can save $250 on the MacBook Pro M2 16-inch with 512GB storage
(opens in new tab)
, down to just $2249.99. If you need more storage, you can also save $200 on the MacBook Pro M2 with a 1TB SSD

The MacBook Pro 16-inch on offer here comes with the M2 Pro chip, which is not only powerful but flexible, too - it can even run many iPad and iPhone apps, alongside everything a Mac can do (which is a lot, by the way).

Apple Silicon also means a lot of the key internal components are embedded on the same chip, so less power is used transferring data between them. This results in a drastically improved battery life over the prior Intel-based models.

Add to that a return of ports (there's a MagSafe connector that supports fast-charging, three USB-C ports, HDMI output and an SD card slot) and the small matter of the best laptop screen we've tested and you've got a terrific all-rounder.

We've not yet reviewed the M2 Pro model, but in our MacBook Pro 16-inch review, we gave it our highest rating, 5 out of 5 stars, saying that: “the MacBook Pro 16-inch is a powerful and stylish laptop that's ideal for resource-intensive tasks like programming, coding, and video editing.”

Given the jump in power here in the same form factor, it's a great option for coding on the go.

It was long thought that pyrite — a shiny mineral also known as fool's gold — was the special ingredient that gave fossils embedded in Germany's Posidonia Shale their golden glow. But now scientists think something else is causing these fossils to shimmer.

Earlier this year, a team of international researchers visited the Early Jurassic site known for its exceptionally well-preserved fossils of marine animals. They collected dozens of samples of fossilized ammonites, bivalves and crustaceans that were about palm-size or larger. 

Once the team viewed the roughly 183 million-year-old fossils using a high-powered scanning electron microscope, they struggled to find any pyrite in the fossils poking out of the black shale, according to a study published in the March 2023 edition of the journal Earth-Science Reviews

""It was long believed that everything [at the Posidonia Shale] was pyritized,"" study co-author Rowan Martindale
(opens in new tab)
, an associate professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, told Live Science. ""We picked samples that we thought for sure would be all pyrite. And lo and behold there was a little bit of pyrite on a couple of them, but basically it was all phosphatized or yellow calcite. It was pretty much a shock to all of us who worked on the paper.""

After analyzing roughly 70 specimens, it was clear that while the shale surrounding the fossils was ""dotted with microscopic clusters of pyrite crystals, called framboids,"" it was phosphate minerals with yellow calcite that were the source of the fossils' golden glow, according to a statement

.

Related: Trilobites had a hidden third eye, new fossils reveal

""The framboids look like tiny raspberries,"" study co-author Sinjini Sinha
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral candidate in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT, told Live Science. ""After looking at the specimens under a microscope, I only found a few framboids on the fossils themselves but counted 600 to 800 on the surrounding shale.""

Knowing that pyrite and phosphate are present in different parts of the specimens is crucial since it reveals information about the fossilization environment. For example, pyrite forms in anoxic environments where there's no oxygen present, whereas phosphate minerals like yellow calcite need oxygen to form, according to the statement.

The research revealed that even though an anoxic seafloor ""set the stage for fossilization,"" it took a burst of oxygen to cause the chemical reactions necessary for fossilization to occur. The oxygenation combined with the phosphate minerals helped turn the fossils into what looks like gold, according to the statement.

Hidden oceans may lurk under the icy crusts of four of Uranus' moons. 

Scientists recently reanalyzed data from the Voyager spacecraft that flew by Uranus in the 1980s and found that four of Uranus' largest moons — Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon — may be warm enough to host liquid oceans. In Titania and Oberon, these oceans might even be warm enough to potentially support life, according to a recent study in the Journal of Geophysical Research
(opens in new tab)
. 

""When it comes to small bodies — dwarf planets and moons — planetary scientists previously have found evidence of oceans in several unlikely places, including the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and Saturn's moon Mimas,"" study lead author Julie Castillo-Rogez
(opens in new tab)
 of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""So there are mechanisms at play that we don't fully understand.""

The new study integrated 1980s Voyager 2 data with information on other icy moons such as Pluto's Charon and Saturn's Enceladus drawn from more recent NASA missions such as Galileo, Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons. Uranus has 27 moons, but the researchers focused on the five largest, which are Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon and Miranda. Of these, Ariel is the smallest at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, while Titania is the largest at 980 miles (1,580 km) across.

Previously, scientists thought only Tatiana was likely to generate any internal heat via radioactive decay — the process by which unstable atoms lose energy through radiation — believing the other moons to be too small. However, modeling the other moons' porosity suggested that all but Miranda are insulated enough to retain internal heat created by radioactive decay. The researchers also found that any potential oceans beneath the icy crusts of these moons would be rich in chlorides, ammonia and salts, both of which would lower the freezing point of the water. The combination of a low freezing point and enough internal heat could mean that Ariel, Umbrial, Titania and Oberon all have oceans dozens of miles deep within their interiors, the researchers reported.

In 2020, scientists detected some evidence of recent geological activity on Ariel
(opens in new tab)
, suggesting the possible movement of a potential inner ocean. Miranda also has surface features that look relatively fresh, according to the researchers, but their modeling suggests that if the moon did have a liquid ocean at some point, it is likely frozen by now. 

To find out if these hidden oceans really exist, scientists will have to get creative. Spectrometers that can detect wavelengths of light reflected by ammonia and chlorides could help prove the presence of these chemicals under the crusts. Scientists could also use instruments that can detect electrical currents carried by liquid water to probe beneath these moons' surfaces. New modeling studies on how these moons formed could also help researchers plan what kind of observations they will need to make in the future, Castillo-Rogez said.

""We need to develop new models for different assumptions on the origin of the moons in order to guide planning for future observations,"" she said.

(Image credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)

A child in Maine who recently tested positive for measles may be the state's first case of the viral infection since 2019, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reported Friday
(opens in new tab)
 (May 5).

While the case still needs to be confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Maine's public health agencies are assuming the child is infectious and working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed.

The CDC recommends
(opens in new tab)
 that children receive their first dose of the MMR vaccine, which guards against measles, mumps and rubella, between 12 months and 15 months old. Children should get their second dose between 4 and 6 years old. Alternatively, the MMRV vaccine, which also guards against varicella (chickenpox), may be given following the same vaccination schedule.

One dose of either vaccine is roughly 93% protective against measles, and two doses are 97% protective, meaning there's a small chance of infection even after two doses. However, vaccinated individuals tend to have much milder cases of the disease than unvaccinated people do.

The Maine child with a positive measles test had received one dose of a measles vaccine. (Neither the child's age nor any of their symptoms, if they had any, were noted in the DHHS statement.)

The Maine DHHS statement includes a list of locations that the measles-positive child recently visited and times they were at each place. ""Anyone at these locations during these times should watch for symptoms for 21 days after their exposure,"" the statement reads. ""If you have symptoms, call a health care provider for instructions before going to the office or hospital to help prevent further spread of infection.""

Between Jan. 1 and April 28, 2023, a total of 10 measles cases were reported nationwide, the CDC reported

While playing outside her school in Norway, an 8-year-old girl found an unexpected treasure — not a lost ball or a discarded jump rope, but a flint dagger crafted by Stone Age people 3,700 years ago.

The student, identified only as Elise in a statement
(opens in new tab)
 translated from Norwegian, discovered the gray-brown dagger when she was playing in a rocky area by her school in Vestland County. ""I was going to pick up a piece of glass, and then the stone was there,"" she said in the statement. 

Elise showed the stone to her teacher, Karen Drange, who saw that the stone looked ancient. Drange contacted Vestland county council, and archaeologists from the county examined the artifact.

The nearly 5-inch-long (12 centimeters) tool is a rare find, Louise Bjerre Petersen
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist with Vestland county municipality, said in the translated statement. Flint, a hard sedimentary rock, does not naturally occur in Norway, so the dagger may have come from across the North Sea in Denmark, according to the statement.

This type of dagger is often found with sacrificial finds, the archaeologists added. To further investigate the area, the Vestland County Council and Vestland County's University Museum in Bergen, Norway's second-largest city, teamed up to explore the school's grounds. But they didn't find any other evidence dating back to the Stone Age, they said in the statement.

Based on its style, the dagger likely dates to the New Stone Age, or the Neolithic, a time when prehistoric humans shaped stone tools
(opens in new tab)
 and began to rely on domesticated plants and animals, build permanent villages and develop crafts, such as pottery. In Norway, the Stone Age, which includes the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, lasted from 10000 B.C. to 1800 B.C., with a number of hunter-gatherers permanently settling down to farm around 2400 B.C., according to Talk Norway
(opens in new tab)
, an educational website on Norway's history and cultural heritage.

The dagger will be cataloged and used in research at the University Museum. The artifact isn't the only Stone Age discovery to recently get attention in Norway. This past winter, the full-body reconstruction of a Stone Age teenager who lived 8,300 years ago went on display at the Hå Gamle Prestegard museum in southern Norway. The teen boy was likely part of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer group, but the details surrounding his death are a mystery; it appears he died alone leaning against a cave wall, as his remains had no indications of a burial.

Astronomers may have just found the remnants of some of the universe's very first stars. The chemical signatures of these faraway, 13-plus-billion-year-old objects are remarkably different from those of younger stars, like our sun. By studying them, scientists hope to shed light on how stars, galaxies and even basic elements form. 

The research, co-authored by University of Florence astrophysicist Stefania Salvadori
(opens in new tab)
, was published May 3 in The Astrophysical Journal
(opens in new tab)
. 

In the earliest days of the universe, only very simple elements such as hydrogen and helium were available. The first stars ignited from these elements alone. Over time, their white-hot cores gradually cooked simple atoms into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, magnesium and eventually metals. Later generations of stars formed from clouds of gas containing these heavier atoms, and today most of the stars scientists observe are rich in metals like iron. (Our sun is about 98% hydrogen and helium, but contains trace amounts of heavier elements like iron, neon and carbon.)

Nobody has observed the original metal-deficient stars directly; most of them probably fizzled out or exploded long ago. But scientists can still observe some of their dusty remains by setting their sights billions of light years away.

—The early universe was crammed with stars 10,000 times the size of our sun, new study suggests

Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), Salvadori and her team peered into three distant clouds of star-forming gas. On their own, these clouds wouldn't tell scientists very much, but incoming light from nearby quasars — extremely bright galactic cores formed by dust falling into a supermassive black hole — helped reveal the cloud's secrets. Based on which wavelengths of light the gas clouds absorbed, the team determined what elements the stellar remains were made of. 

Sure enough, the clouds were extremely poor in iron and other metallic elements, but rich in carbon, oxygen and magnesium — precisely what would have been left over after the first stars ran out of fuel and exploded, according to the researchers. This tracks with other research into the origins of stars, and may help explain the composition of younger stars, including those found in the Milky Way. 

""Our discovery opens new avenues to indirectly study the nature of the first stars, fully complementing studies of stars in our galaxy,"" Salvadori said in a statement

It's well known that the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin plays a key role in sleep. But other hormones, including the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone, can also affect our sleep — and potentially even our dreams. 

In particular, people may notice differences in the quality of their sleep and the way they dream at different stages of their menstrual cycle, experts told Live Science. Here's how the menstrual cycle might affect sleep and dreaming.

How the menstrual cycle affects sleep and dreams 

Sleep is broken down into stages, broadly known as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People dream during REM sleep, which usually begins about 90 minutes after a person falls asleep, said Dr. Tania Adib
(opens in new tab)
, a consultant gynecologist at The Lister Hospital in the U.K. 

NREM sleep is broken up into four stages: easily disturbed light sleep, a deeper intermediate sleep, and two stages of deep sleep, which occurs just before REM sleep, according to the Mayo Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. Deep sleep is the most restorative and where the body and brain have time to repair.

Estrogen and progesterone can affect how much time people spend in REM and NREM sleep and whether they wake up often while dreaming.

""There are lots of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the parts of the brain that regulate sleep, and because the levels of these hormones change during the menstrual cycle, it means our sleep also varies across the month,"" said Dr. Zoe Schaedel
(opens in new tab)
, co-founder of Myla Health, a private clinic for women experiencing menopause, perimenopause and reproductive health issues in England. 

The menstrual cycle has four stages: menses (when the period occurs), the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, according to the Cleveland Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. The menstrual cycle ""begins"" on the first day of a period. Prior to ovulation, which occurs roughly around day 14, estrogen levels rise, Schaedel told Live Science. ""Sleep tends to be better-quality in this phase, known as the follicular or proliferative phase.""  

After ovulation, progesterone levels then begin to rise and eventually overtake estrogen; if a pregnancy doesn't occur, the levels of both hormones drop in the lead-up to menstration. ""This is known as the 'luteal phase' and is where we see changes in the structure of sleep,"" Schaedel said.

Shifting progesterone levels during the luteal phase may partly cause disturbed sleep in the lead-up to a person's period, Schaedel said. 

Compared to estrogen, progesterone is thought to be more strongly tied to premenstrual symptoms (PMS), which occur during the luteal phase and commonly include insomnia or oversleeping, according to Mount Sinai.
(opens in new tab)
 These sleep changes aren't fully understood, but rising progesterone in the luteal phase is linked to increased body temperatures and sweating
(opens in new tab)
, which may interfere with sleep because normally, body temperatures decline before and during sleep. The overall ratio of REM to NREM sleep may also decrease during this phase, according to a 2021 review in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience
(opens in new tab)
. 

RELATED STORIES

—Do dreams really reveal our deepest secrets?

—Does the moon affect menstrual cycles?

—Why can't we remember our dreams?

Progesterone and estrogen help modulate chemical messengers in the brain — namely, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) — which regulate mood and stress levels, according to Mount Sinai. Anxiousness and depressed mood due to PMS may undermine people's attempts to fall asleep
(opens in new tab)
, and physical symptoms, like body aches and nausea, may also help explain why people experiencing PMS are prone to sleep disruptions, per the Frontiers in Neuroscience review. 

Melatonin production and sensitivity may also change during the luteal phase, some studies hint, but the research is ""not sufficient""
(opens in new tab)
 to draw strong conclusions.

Sleep disturbances in the luteal phase may increase the likelihood that individuals remember their vivid dreams, Schaedel said. 

""If sleep fragments REM, or you wake up shortly after the REM stage, you are far more likely to remember your dreams,"" Adib told Live Science.

One 2019 study hinted that hormones may also affect the types of dreams a person has
(opens in new tab)
. The study asked hundreds of women to recall the previous night's dreams. Of the women who could remember, those in the luteal phase more often reported their dreams as being ""pleasant,"" while those in other parts of the menstrual cycle were more likely to report their dreams being ""unpleasant."" 

However, it's unclear whether this result would carry over to other, larger groups of people.

A school of piranhas attacked holiday makers playing in a stream in a Brazilian resort on May 1, leaving at least eight people injured.

The fish tore at the bathers' legs and feet with their razor-sharp teeth, driving them out of the water and onto a tourist beach in Tarumã-Açu, a region northeast of Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazonas.

Experts think the biting frenzy was a case of ""mistaken identity"" and that the piranhas were actually after the food that visitors at local restaurants sometimes throw into the river.

""Piranhas do not exhibit unprovoked attacks on humans,"" Steve Huskey
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of biology at Western Kentucky University, told Live Science in an email. ""The situation described is one of piranhas becoming acclimated to free food and those bites were just another example of mistaken identity, just like shark attacks.""

Some piranha species, including the red-bellied piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), engage in collective feeding frenzies. ""Species of the genus Pygocentrus, that occur in the Amazon and São Francisco river drainages, are most dangerous,"" Paulo Andreas Buckup
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist and professor at the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, told Live Science in an email.

But this behavior only occurs in exceptional circumstances, such as when a high number of fish are trapped in small pools or starved for a long time, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium
(opens in new tab)
. ""These fish swim in schools and normally do not attack large animals,"" Buckup said.

Related: Swarms of 'mini-shark' beach bugs are on a foot-biting rampage in California 

Most piranhas are harmless and the meat-eating species tend to scavenge rather than hunt living animals. ""Some species of the piranha family eat only fruit, insects and vegetable matter. Some specialize in eating fish scales and nibbling the fins of other fish,"" Buckup said. ""They may attack other live fish or animals, but they will eat dead flesh whenever it is available.""

The presence of bathers in a feeding spot, however, can lead to confusion and aggression. ""Feeding piranhas in a tourist setting strengthens their natural behaviors to school and bite,"" Mark Sabaj Perez
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, Philadelphia, told Live Science in an email.

The attack in Tarumã-Açu could have been triggered by a single piranha mistaking a foot for food, taking a mouthful and drawing blood, which in turn sparked a feeding frenzy. ""An attack is likely to have been caused by presence of blood in the water, skin injuries or movement that appears as a fish in distress,"" Buckup said. ""Because their teeth are so sharp, a single bite [could] cause a lot of bleeding and trigger group feeding frenzy behavior.""

Once the meal begins, piranhas dart in and out to bite their prey at great speed to avoid being accidentally nipped by another individual, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium.

Piranhas have the strongest bite recorded in bony fish — as powerful as a great white shark, according to a 2012 study published in the journal Scientific Reports
(opens in new tab)
. The black piranha (Serrasalmus rhombeus) generates a bite force equivalent to 35 times its body weight, compared to just one time its body weight for a great white, according to Huskey.

""When a piranha focuses that bite force onto their 14 razor-sharp teeth, the bite pressure climbs to immeasurable levels,"" Huskey said. ""They could do tremendous damage to humans throughout South America, if they were so inclined, but they're not… and they don't.""

A rock likely to be a meteorite crashed into a New Jersey home on Monday (May 8), damaging a bedroom but causing no injuries. 

No one was at Suzy Kop's home in Hopewell Township, New Jersey, when the space rock made its entrance, according to CBS News Philadelphia
(opens in new tab)
, which first reported the unusual event. The meteorite landed around 1 p.m. EDT, crashing through the roof and landing in the bedroom belonging to Kop's father. Judging by the damage, the meteorite hit the floor, bounced to the ceiling, and came to rest in the corner of a room. The metallic rock measures about 4 inches by 6 inches (10 by 15 centimeters). 

""I did touch the thing because I thought it was a random rock… and it was warm,"" Kop told CBS News.

Authorities are still investigating the origin of the apparent space rock, but Derrick Pitts
(opens in new tab)
, the chief astronomer at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, told CBS News that it could be four to five billion years old. It’s possible that the meteorite was part of the ongoing Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which roughly occurs between April 19 and May 29 each year, and which reached its peak around May 5 and 6. During peak days, the shower can produce hundreds of ""shooting stars"" per hour – most of which are meteors that burn up in the atmosphere. These meteors are the rocky debris left by Halley’s Comet, which becomes visible from Earth every 75 to 79 years, according to NASA

""For it to actually strike a house, for people to be able to pick up, that's really unusual and has happened very few times in history,"" Pitts said.

The meteor event that caused the most injuries did not involve anyone being hit directly by a space rock. In February 2013, a meteor estimated at 59 feet (18 m) in diameter zinged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia. The resulting fireball blew out windows and damaged buildings, causing more than 1,600 reported injuries due to flying glass and debris, according to NASA

(Image credit: EmirMemedovski via Getty Images)

Sleep apnea may be linked to certain indicators of worse brain health, according to a new study.

The study, published Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Neurology
(opens in new tab)
, looked at people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition where the upper throat muscles relax during sleep and block the airway. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sleep studies to examine if sleep apnea and altered sleep were associated with two kinds of unusual patterns in the brain's white matter — the insulated wires that extend from brain cells.

Both severe sleep apnea and reduced time spent in the deep stages of sleep were associated with these two biomarkers, which have each previously been linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or general cognitive decline, as well as having a stroke.

The researchers found ""a pretty significant association between slow-wave sleep duration, or deep sleep time, and these white matter measures,"" said Bryce Mander
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.

Related: Human brain looks years 'older' after just one night without sleep, small study shows 

The study included 140 people with OSA whose average age was about 73 years old. All the participants were screened for one of the two biomarkers, but only 103 were screened for the second, as well. The overall group was relatively evenly split between people with mild, moderate and severe OSA, and most people had no cognitive impairment during the study.

One of the biomarkers that the researchers looked for in brain scans were white matter hyperintensities, ""bright spots commonly seen in the white matter of the brain on MRI, which appear with aging and vascular disease,"" Dr. Diego Carvalho
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine and the senior author of the study, wrote in an email to Live Science. ""They represent areas of damage to the white matter.""

The second biomarker, called ""fractional anisotropy of the genu of the corpus callosum,"" is related to how water flows through brain cells' wires, or axons. Changes in this water flow, wrote Carvalho, are related to axon damage and can be an early sign of vascular disease. The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain and contains the organ's densest white matter. 

Using polysomnography, meaning the variety of data collected during a sleep study, the researchers found that participants who spent less time in slow-wave sleep appeared more affected by both types of biomarkers in their MRIs. Separately, people with severe OSA also appeared more impacted by white matter abnormalities than people with mild or moderate OSA. 

The research reveals associations between sleep apnea, deep sleep, and white matter abnormalities, but it can't say whether these sleep differences caused the abnormalities, or if differences in white matter could be interfering with sleep. It also could be that sleep and white matter abnormalities impact one another, said Mander, contributing to a vicious cycle of poor sleep quality and worse brain health.

""To me, I think that's the most likely outcome,"" he said.

One limitation of the study is that polysomnography data was only collected for the first few hours participants slept; people's sleep patterns might have differed later in the night. After their sleep study, anyone who met criteria for sleep apnea was given treatment in the form of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which can help keep the airway open. Carvalho said that data from this ""treatment phase"" wasn't included because differences in how people responded to the CPAP would have muddied the data.

MRIs and polysomnography were taken, on average, about 1.7 years apart, but researchers only collected each type of data at one point in time, offering only snapshots of patients' brains and sleep patterns and not how they might change over time. The study also did not follow participants to see who might go on to develop dementia.  

Mander said that future research should examine how sleep apnea's impact on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage of sleep when most dreaming happens, might affect the brain. (Slow-wave sleep occurs in certain stages of non-REM sleep.) However, the new study introduces important ideas about ""how sleep apnea and sleep disturbance might be associated with cognitive decline,"" he said.

(Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)

Scientists have published the first human ""pangenome"" — a full genetic sequence that incorporates genomes from not just one individual, but 47. 

These 47 individuals hail from around the globe and thus vastly increase the diversity of the genomes represented in the sequence, compared to the previous full human genome sequence that scientists use as their reference for study. The first human genome sequence was released with some gaps in 2003 and only made ""gapless"" in 2022. If that first human genome is a simple linear string of genetic code, the new pangenome is a series of branching paths.

The ultimate goal of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, which published the first draft of the pangenome on Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Nature
(opens in new tab)
, is to sequence at least 350 individuals from different populations around the world. Although 99.9% of the genome is the same from person to person, there is a lot of diversity found in that final 0.1%.

""Rather than using a single genome sequence as our coordinate system, we should instead have a representation that is based on the genomes of many different people so we can better capture genetic diversity in humans,"" Melissa Gymrek
(opens in new tab)
, a genetics researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the project, told Live Science. 

Related: More than 150 'made-from-scratch' genes are in the human genome. 2 are totally unique to us. 

The newly drafted human pangenome is a collection of different genomes from which to compare an individual genome sequence. Like a map of the subway system, the pangenome graph has many possible routes for a sequence to take, represented by the different colors.   The detouring paths at the top of the image represent single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which are single letter differences. The yellow path that loops around itself and repeats the same nucleotides represents a duplication variant. The pink path that loops counterclockwise and follows the nucleotide sequence backwards represents an inversion variant. At the bottom, the green and dark blue paths miss the C nucleotide in its route and represent a deletion variant. The light blue path, which has extra nucleotides in its route, represents an insertion variant. (Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)
A reference for health 

The first full human genome sequence was completed in 2003 by the Human Genome Project and was based on one person's DNA. Later, bits and pieces from about 20 other individuals were added, but 70% of the sequence scientists use to benchmark genetic variation still comes from a single person. 

Geneticists use the reference genome as a guide when sequencing pieces of people's genetic codes, Arya Massarat
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student in Gymrek's lab who co-authored an editorial about the new research with her in the journal Nature, told Live Science. They match the newly decoded DNA snippets to the reference to figure out how they fit within the genome as a whole. They also use the reference genome as a standard to pinpoint genetic variations — different versions of genes that diverge from the reference — that might be linked with health conditions. 

But with a single reference mostly from one person, scientists have only a limited window of genetic diversity to study.

The first pangenome draft now doubles the number of large genome variants, known as structural variants, that scientists can detect, bringing them up to 18,000. These are places in the genome where large chunks have been deleted, inserted or rearranged. The new draft also adds 119 million new base pairs, meaning the paired ""letters"" that make up the DNA sequence, and 1,115 new gene duplication mutations to the previous version of the human genome.

""It really is understanding and cataloging these differences between genomes that allow us to understand how cells operate and their biology and how they function, as well as understanding genetic differences and how they contribute to understanding human disease,"" study co-author Karen Miga
(opens in new tab)
, a geneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said at a press conference held May 9. 

The pangenome could help scientists get a better grasp of complex conditions in which genes play an influential role, such as autism, schizophrenia, immune disorders and coronary heart disease, researchers involved with the study said at the press conference. 

For example, the Lipoprotein A gene is known to be one of the biggest risk factors for coronary heart disease in African Americans, but the specific genetic changes involved are complex and poorly understood, study co-author Evan Eichler
(opens in new tab)
, a genomics researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, told reporters. With the pangenome, researchers can now more thoroughly compare the variation in people with heart disease and without, and this could help clarify individuals' risk of heart disease based on what variants of the gene they carry. 

Related: As little as 1.5% of our genome is 'uniquely human'  

A diverse understanding 

The current pangenome draft used data from participants in the 1000 Genomes Project, which was the first attempt to sequence genomes from a large number of people from around the world. The included participants had agreed for their genetic sequences to be anonymized and included in publicly available databases. 

The new study also used advanced sequencing technology called ""long-read sequencing,"" as opposed to the short-read sequencing that came before. Short-read sequencing is what happens when you send your DNA to a company like 23andMe, Eichler said. Researchers read out small segments of DNA and then stitch them together into a whole. This kind of sequencing can capture a decent amount of genetic variation, but there can be poor overlap between each DNA fragment. Long-read sequencing, on the other hand, captures big segments of DNA all at once.

While it's possible to sequence a genome with short-read sequencing for about $500, long-read sequencing is still expensive, costing about $10,000 a genome, Eichler said. The price is coming down, however, and the pangenome team hopes to sequence their next batches of genomes at half that cost or less. 

The researchers are working to recruit new participants to continue to fill in diversity gaps in the pangenome, study co-author Eimear Kenny
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of medicine and genetics at  the Institute for Genomic Health at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told reporters. Because genetic information is sensitive and because different rules govern data-sharing and privacy in different countries, this is delicate work. Issues include privacy, informed consent, and the possibility of discrimination based on genetic information, Kenny said. 

Already, researchers are uncovering new genetic processes with the draft pangenome. In two papers published in Nature alongside the work, researchers looked at highly repetitive segments of the genome. These segments have traditionally been difficult to study, biochemist Brian McStay
(opens in new tab)
 of the National University of Ireland Galway, told Live Science, because sequencing them via short-read technology makes it hard to understand how they fit together. The long read technology allows for long chunks of these repetitive sequences to be read at once. 

The studies found that in one type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
, known as segmental duplications, there is a larger than expected amount of variation, potentially a mechanism for the long-term evolution of new functions for genes. In another type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
 that is responsible for building the cellular machines that create new proteins, though, the genome stays remarkably stable. The pangenome allowed researchers to discover a potential mechanism for how these key segments of DNA stay consistent over time.

""This is just the start,"" McStay said. ""There will be a whole lot of new biology that will come out of this.""

Humpback whales have — for the first time ever — been filmed rolling to and fro on sandy seabeds to scrub off dead skin and unwanted hitchhikers.

Footage captured by researchers in the Gold Coast Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia, shows the gigantic marine mammals performing full and side ""sand rolls"" up to 164 feet (50 meters) below the ocean's surface to shed parasites that live on their skin, known as ectoparasites, which can make the whales less hydrodynamic.

""We believe that the whales exfoliate using the sand to assist with molting and removal of ectoparasites, such as barnacles, and specifically select areas suitable for this behavior,"" Olaf Meynecke
(opens in new tab)
, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia who led the research, said in a statement

Although humpback whales have been spotted hovering and feeding near the seafloor before, this is the first time researchers have recorded them rolling in the sand. A 2016 study published in the journal Marine Biodiversity Records
(opens in new tab)
 suggested that humpbacks used the seabed for hygienic purposes, but the reported sightings were opportunistic and made from a boat rather than underwater.

Barnacles are sturdy little crustaceans related to lobsters and shrimp. They cement themselves to other sea creatures with one of the most powerful known natural glues, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ocean Service
(opens in new tab)
. Whales need to remove these crusty parasites to stay streamlined and preserve energy, according to a study describing the sand rolling behavior, published March 12 in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering
(opens in new tab)
.

The whales picked a shallow, sandy location near their migration route to exfoliate, moving head first through the substrate while they rolled. The density of parasites is generally higher around the face than elsewhere, so getting rid of them requires a rigorous rub, according to the study.

The researchers tagged three humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) between August 2021 and October 2022 using suction-cup sensors that recorded high-definition video, as well as light, pressure, temperature and GPS data. The animals were on their summer migration path from tropical breeding grounds near the Great Barrier Reef, to cooler feeding grounds in Antarctica.

While they cannot exclude the possibility that the whales were trying to scratch off the tags, the researchers note that other individuals that were not tagged were also seen rolling across the seabed in the new footage. The tagged humpbacks also did not seem to be targeting the skin carrying the sensors.

The whale exfoliation also provided a tasty snack for small fish called silver trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus), which were seen feeding on dead skin flakes just after the sand rolls.

As well as staying streamlined, exfoliating on the seabed could help humpbacks maintain healthy skin. 

""Humpback whales host diverse communities of skin bacteria that can pose a threat for open wounds if bacteria grow in large numbers,"" Meynecke said. ""Removing excess skin is likely a necessity to maintain a healthy bacterial skin community."" Humpbacks remove some barnacles and skin via breaches — where a whale leaps from the water — but not all, he said.

Rolling around could also be a social activity related to play or relaxation. ""During the different deployments, the sand rolling was observed in the context of socializing,"" Meynecke said. ""The behavior was either following courtship, competition or other forms of socializing."" Other whale species, including bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) are known to rub against rocks, pebbles and mud on the seafloor to shed excess skin.

If you're looking for a quality fitness tracker for yourself or a family member, and want to save some money, we've found a great Fitbit Charge 5 deal for you. Amazon have knocked a fantastic 32% off the retail price
(opens in new tab)
, bringing this best Fitbit down to $102: there has never been a better time to join the Fitbit club!

We've tested this model extensively, and you can read our Fitbit Charge 5 review to get a better understanding of what it's all about. If you just want to know if it's any good... well, it is listed in our guide to the best fitness trackers — and for good reason. The Fitbit model comes with full GPS, an ECG feature, and it's one of the few Fitbits that has a clever EDA sensor, which can measure stress. The only other models that offer this are the more high-end trackers in Fitbit's range, like the Versa and the Sense, which right now cost around $100 more.

If you're not convinced whether you want a Charge 5 or a different Fitbit altogether, we've done some handy comparisons to help you decide: Fitbit Charge 4 vs Charge 5 and Fitbit Inspire 3 vs Fitbit Charge 5.

Fitbit Charge 5 | Was $149.95, Now $102.00 on Amazon
Save a brilliant 32% on one of the top fitness trackers on the market. Coming with a 7-day battery life, built-in GPS, advanced health features like an ECG and EDA function along with the ability to track your sleep, this stellar fitness band is suitable for most people. 

VIEW DEAL

Our favorite features of this model are the sleep tracking options, the heart rate monitor, built-in GPS, and the handy stress management sensor. 

Plus, if you do take the plunge but decide that the Fitbit Charge 5 isn't right for you (or your loved one), you can always return the wearable, as long as it hasn't been used. 

Here at Live Science, we've tried and tested many great fitness trackers and some of the best running watches for both the US and UK markets, from the likes of Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit. 

So we speak from experience when we say that the Charge 5 is one of the best models for anyone looking to pick up their first fitness tracker. It has all the features you need to really hone both your fitness and wellness routine, without breaking the bank. The band comes in three different colors: graphite black, lunar white and steel blue, so it'll suit most workout outfits.

We appreciate some of the enhanced personal safety features too, like the GPS, which allows for phone-free route tracking; and the ECG sensor which analyses your heart rhythm to check for abnormalities. But if we're honest, it's the impressive EDA stress sensor that Fitbit introduced into the watch that makes it stand out from the crowd. Who wouldn't want to track and stay on top of their stress levels?

It does also come with blood oxygenation readings and fitness plans. If you pay the $102 price tag today, the watch includes a 6-month Fitbit Premium trial, although you'll need to pay an extra $9.99 a month thereafter to access these features.

Shark attacks are extremely rare
(opens in new tab)
 — you're unlikely to meet one in the flesh, let alone be bitten. But during World War II, the sinking of a U.S. Navy ship led to one of the most infamous shark attacks in history and the deaths of hundreds of men, with the explosion drawing in the apex predators and sparking a feeding frenzy that lasted for days.

In July 1945, the USS Indianapolis had completed a trip to a naval base on the Pacific island of Tinian to deliver uranium and other components that would be used to create the atomic bomb ""Little Boy."" The first nuclear weapon ever used in wartime, it would later be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

After delivering the parts, the Indianapolis departed for the Philippines on training duty. Shortly after midnight on July 30, the ship was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, causing massive damage. It began to take on huge amounts of water, and sank in just 12 minutes. Of the 1,195 men
(opens in new tab)
 on board, around 300 went down with the ship, but nearly 900 were left adrift in the open ocean.

Many died of exposure, dehydration and saltwater poisoning. However, according to Smithsonian Magazine, up to 150 sailors and crew are estimated to have been killed by sharks — in what is considered the worst shark attack in history. But why?

Dangerous sharks and how they hunt

Unlike some other predators, such as lions and wolves, most sharks hunt alone, Nico Booyens, a marine biologist and director of research at the Shark Research Unit
(opens in new tab)
 in South Africa, told Live Science in an email. ""Different shark species have different hunting techniques, but many sharks are solitary predators that rely on their senses of sight, smell and electroreception to locate their prey.""

Sharks also have a special system called a lateral line
(opens in new tab)
 that picks up the vibrations in the water, Booyens says. This sensory ability would have allowed them to detect the movement of the men in the water as they thrashed around to stay afloat. Once the sharks had located the sailors, they stood little chance of survival — especially those who were injured.

Related: In rare attack, great white shark decapitates diver in Mexico. But why?

According to survivor accounts, many victims were attacked near the surface of the water. This has since led to suggestions that oceanic whitetip sharks
(opens in new tab)
 (Carcharhinus longimanus) were the involved in the attacks because they are a surface-dwelling species
(opens in new tab)
.

""When a shark has located its prey, it will often use its sharp teeth and powerful jaws to bite and tear chunks of flesh from the prey,"" Booyens added. ""Some sharks, like the tiger shark [Galeocerdo cuvier], are known for their ability to swallow their prey whole, while others, like the bull shark [Carcharhinus leucas], will attack and bite their prey repeatedly until it is weakened or immobilized.""

Although oceanic whitetips are at the top of the food chain, their meals can be few and far between, so they are often opportunistic feeders. According to the Florida Museum
(opens in new tab)
, the species is often the first to appear at the site of oceanic disasters, and was also a major cause of fatalities after the sinking of the RMS Nova Scotia in 1942. The species is known to be persistent, unpredictable and shows little fear, making it particularly dangerous to humans, the Florida Museum said.

The worst shark attack in history 

Oceanic whitetip sharks was a major cause of concern for downed planes and sunken ships during World War II and is often the first species at the scene of ocean disasters.  (Image credit: atese/Getty Images)

At the USS Indianapolis, the bodies of the dead and the injured were picked off first. Survivor Corporal Edgar Harrell told the Indianapolis Star
(opens in new tab)
 in 2014: ""That first morning, we had sharks."" As men got separated they would be targeted,"" he explained. ""You hear a blood-curdling scream. And then the body would go under, and then that life vest popped back up.""

The men were too scared to eat or move, for fear of being preyed upon. According to the report of a survivor, one of the sailors opened a can of Spam, the primary ration at the time, but was surrounded by sharks, resulting in a ""feeding frenzy.""

""Feeding frenzies typically occur when there is a sudden abundance of food, such as when a large school of fish is trapped in a small area,"" Booyens said. ""The scent of blood and the thrashing of prey can trigger a feeding frenzy, causing sharks to swarm and compete for the available food.""

The survivors of the USS Indianapolis were at sea for four days before rescue teams arrived.  (Image credit: PhotoQuest/Getty Images)

Many species of shark may engage in frenzied hunting, during which they can become very aggressive and attack each other as well as the prey. However, oceanic whitetips’ opportunistic feeding behavior — as well as their size and strength — made them particularly dangerous for the sailors. ""Feeding frenzies can be dangerous for humans who happen to be in the water, as the sharks may not be able to distinguish between prey and people,"" Booyens added.

For four days, no rescue arrived. Although the U.S. Navy had received word that a Japanese submarine had sunk a U.S. vessel, the message was believed to be fake — in an attempt to lure American rescue boats into a trap. Meanwhile, the survivors tried to stay alive by floating in groups, but in the scorching heat, many succumbed to dehydration. Others died from hypernatremia — too much sodium in the blood — from being forced to drink the salty seawater.

Eventually, a Navy plane flying overhead spotted the Indianapolis survivors and radioed for help. Food, water and rafts were dropped for the surviving men, before a seaplane was landed by Lt. Adrian Marks to rescue some of the survivors from the sharks. Finally, the USS Cecil J. Doyle helped to pull the remaining survivors from the water. Only 316 men survived.

(Image credit: SrdjanPav via Getty Images)

Ice age groups in the ancient northern coast of China helped make up the first wave of people to settle the New World, a new DNA study suggests.

The ancient groups may have also migrated to Japan, potentially helping explain similarities in Stone Age artifacts in the Americas, China and Japan, according to the study, published Tuesday (May 9) in the journal Cell Reports
(opens in new tab)
.

There are two leading models as to how people first migrated to the Americas. The older idea suggests that ancient Siberians made this journey when the Bering Land Bridge — the landmass that once connected Asia with North America — was relatively free of ice. More recent evidence argues that multiple waves of humans journeyed to the Americas from various parts of Eurasia, perhaps on watercraft along the Pacific coasts of Asia, the Bering Land Bridge and North America.

To shed light on the origins of Indigenous Americans, scientists examined DNA from mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria possess their own genes, which are passed down from the mother.

The researchers analyzed more than 100,000 contemporary and 15,000 ancient DNA samples from across Eurasia. They focused on a rare mitochondrial DNA lineage called D4h, which is currently found in only about 1 in 200 people worldwide.

""This genetic type had only been sporadically reported in different studies,"" study lead author Yu-Chun Li
(opens in new tab)
, a molecular anthropologist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China, told Live Science in an email. ""Therefore, this female lineage, as well as its origin and dispersal history — especially its dispersal into the Americas — gained little attention until now."" 

Previous research
(opens in new tab)
 found that one branch of D4h, known as D4h3a, was seen in Indigenous Americans, while another offshoot named D4h3b was detected in China and Thailand. This suggested that ancient members of the D4h lineage might help bridge Asia and the Americas.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (26,500 to 19,000 years ago), ice age humans with the maternal lineage D4h3a left Asia and likely crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

""The most difficult work was to collect as many samples belonging to D4h as we could,"" study senior author Qing-Peng Kong
(opens in new tab)
, an evolutionary geneticist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, told Live Science in an email.

By comparing mutations seen in mitochondrial DNA over time, as well as the geographic locations and radiocarbon dates of the fossils from which ancient DNA was collected, the scientists found D4h3a likely originated in northern coastal China.

""The ancestral sources of Native Americans in Asia are more complicated than previously indicated,"" Li said.

The new findings suggest that the ancestors and closest relatives of D4h3a entered the Americas through at least two migrations. Both diasporas apparently occurred when the land bridge from Asia to the Americas was obstructed by ice, so the researchers suggest that ice age people may have traveled via the Pacific coast instead. 

The first migration likely happened between 19,500 and 26,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest part of the last ice age, the researchers said. Back then, ice sheets covered much of the planet, and living in northern China would have likely proven difficult for humans.

During the last deglaciation (19,000 to 11,500 years ago), people from what is now northern China likely journeyed to Japan. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

The scientists estimated the second event apparently occurred between 19,000 and 11,500 years ago, when the ice sheets began melting. Prior work suggested this climate shift likely helped support the rapid growth seen in human populations during this era, which may have helped drive their spread into other regions.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that during the second wave, one lineage branched out from northern coastal China and traveled to Japan, where they contributed to the Japanese gene pool, especially the indigenous Ainu people. ""This points to an unexpected genetic link between Native Americans and the Japanese,"" Kong said.

In all, the new study ""matches well with what we know about the archaeological record of Japan, and lends weight to current models of how humans came to populate the Americas,"" Loren Davis
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis who did not take part in this research, told Live Science in an email.

—Humans crossed the Bering Land Bridge to people the Americas. Here's what it looked like 18,000 years ago.

This discovery may help explain some archeological similarities that prior work controversially suggested at times existed between Stone Age peoples in China, Japan and the Americas. Specifically, researchers had argued the three regions possessed similarities in how they crafted ""stemmed projectile points"" for arrowheads and spears. 

Although the scientists focused on mitochondrial DNA, additional genetic analyses they conducted suggest that male ancestors of Indigenous Americans also lived in northern China at about the same time as these female ancestors.

However, while the new study is exciting, it's just ""another piece of the puzzle,"" on how and when ice age humans first populated the Americas, Davis said. For instance, the researchers stressed that while these new findings suggest this single northern Chinese lineage may have contributed to Indigenous American ancestry, ""it does not represent the whole history of all Native Americans,"" Li said. ""Investigating other lineages showing genetic connections between Asia and the Americas will help obtain the whole picture of the history of Native Americans.""

Earth probably shouldn't exist. 

That's because the orbits of the inner solar system planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are chaotic, and models have suggested that these inner planets should have crashed into each other by now. And yet, that hasn't happened.

New research published May 3 in the journal Physical Review X
(opens in new tab)
 may finally explain why.

Through a deep plunge into the models for planetary motion, the researchers discovered that the motions of the inner planets are constrained by certain parameters that act as a tether that inhibits the system's chaos. Besides providing a mathematical explanation for the apparent harmony in our solar system, the new study's insights may help scientists understand the trajectories of exoplanets surrounding other stars. 

Unpredictable planets

Planets constantly exert a mutual gravitational pull on each other – and these little tugs constantly make minor adjustments to the planets' orbits. The outer planets, which are much larger, are more resistant to little tugs and so maintain comparatively stable orbits. 

The problem of inner planet trajectories, however, is still too complicated to solve exactly. In the late 19th century, mathematician Henri Poincaré proved that it is mathematically impossible to solve the equations governing the motion for three or more interacting objects, often known as the ""three body problem."" As a result, uncertainties in the details of the planets' starting positions and velocities balloon over time. In other words: It is possible to take two scenarios in which the distances between Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth differ by the slightest amount, and in one the planets smash into each other and in another they veer apart.

The time it takes for two trajectories with almost identical starting conditions to diverge by a specific amount is known as the Lyapunov time of the chaotic system. In 1989, Jacques Laskar
(opens in new tab)
, astronomer and research director at the National Center for Scientific Research and Paris Observatory and a co-author of the new study, calculated the characteristic Lyapunov time 
(opens in new tab)
for the planetary orbits of the inner solar system was just 5 million years. 

""It means basically that you lose one digit every 10 million years,"" Laskar, told Live Science. So, for example if the initial uncertainty in the position of a planet is 15 meters, 10 million years later this uncertainty would be 150 meters; after 100 million years, a further 9 digits are lost, giving an uncertainty of 150 million kilometers, equivalent to the distance between Earth and the sun. ""Basically you have no idea where the planet is,"" said Laskar.

While 100 million years may seem long, the solar system itself is over 4.5 billion years old, and the lack of dramatic events — such as a planetary collision or a planet being ejected from all this chaotic motion — long puzzled scientists. 

Laskar then looked at the problem in a different way: by simulating the inner planet trajectories over the next 5 billion years, stepping from one moment to the next. He found just a 1% chance of a planetary collision. With the same approach, he calculated that it would take, on average, about 30 billion years for any of the planets to collide. 

Reining in the chaos

Delving through the math, Laskar and his colleagues then identified for the first time ""symmetries"" or ""conserved quantities"" in the gravitational interactions that create a ""practical barrier in the chaotic wandering of the planets,"" Laskar said. 

These emergent quantities remain nearly constant and inhibit certain chaotic motions, but don't prevent them altogether, much like the raised lip of a dinner plate will inhibit food falling off the plate but not prevent it completely. We can thank these quantities for our solar system's apparent stability.

Renu Malhotra
(opens in new tab)
, Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study, highlighted how subtle the mechanisms identified in the study are. Malhotra told Live Science that it is interesting that ""our solar system's planetary orbits exhibit exceptionally weak chaos."" 

In other work, Laskar and colleagues are searching for clues as to whether the number of planets in the solar system ever differed from what we currently see. For all the stability evident today, whether that has always been the case over the billions of years before life evolved remains an open question.

Here's what it told them.","Scientists dug into a 2,200-year-old pile of Andean condor poop to study the species’ diet and changes in habitat.","For thousands of years, Andean condors have frequented a cliffside nest, resulting in a ring-shaped guano deposit that continues to increase year after year. A condor chick can be seen in the background. (Image credit: L. Sympson)

For the past 2,200 years, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), among the largest known flying birds in the world, have been nesting — and pooping — at a cliffside grotto in northern Patagonia, Argentina. Now researchers are studying the massive pile of guano to learn more about the threatened species and how it has adapted to its environment over time. 

To study the doughnut-shaped poop mound, which measures roughly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, researchers carved it like a pie, removing a single 10-inch-deep (25 centimeters) slice of excrement. Thanks to the deposit's location inside the grotto, the preserved poo had been well protected from wind and rain, allowing it to amass for thousands of years, according to a study published May 3 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B
(opens in new tab)
.

""By looking at the different layers, we could go back in time,"" lead study author Matthew Duda
(opens in new tab)
, a graduate student of biology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, told Live Science. ""We carbon dated [the pile] to figure out the nest's age, which is over 2,000 years old.""

By examining the preserved poo, the team discovered how the condors' diets had evolved over time.

""Condors are scavengers, and at one time they would fly along the shores and eat carcasses of whales and native species such as llamas and alpacas,"" Duda said. ""But as livestock like sheep and cattle were introduced into South America [by Europeans], their diets changed along with it. We saw a complete shift from before to what is currently most abundant for them to eat.""

Related: Critically endangered condor chicks are species' 1st known 'virgin births'

Unfortunately, this shift also meant the condors are ingesting more lead, which Duda attributed to ""lead shot being used to kill vermin, which the condors would then eat."" These toxic metals were then excreted by the birds.

""We saw that the concentration of lead was significantly higher now than in the past,"" Duda said.

This is particularly concerning since Andean condors are on the Red List of Threatened Species monitored by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
(opens in new tab)
, and their numbers continue to dwindle with only about 6,700 adults still living in the wild.

The researchers also noticed that for one 1,000-year stretch of time, roughly between 650 and 1,650 years ago, the condors more or less abandoned the site, resulting in the guano accumulation dropping drastically from approximately 3 cubic feet (0.08 cubic m) per year to 0.11 cubic feet (0.003 cubic m) per year. They think that increased volcanic activity forced the condors to leave, according to the study.

""We measured an increase in sulfur and sodium, which are both associated with volcanic activity,"" said Duda, who suspects that as volcanic ash blanketed the surrounding vegetation, herbivores were forced to leave in search of new food resources, causing the condors to take flight too.

, a nocturnal fruit-eating bird that uses echolocation to navigate.

""It is clear that quality breeding sites are critical for this species' survival,"" the study authors wrote in their paper. ""To support effective conservation efforts, nesting and roosting sites need extensive protection.""

A new species of deep-sea shark with bright white eyes has finally been identified, decades after a dead pregnant female of the species was first collected off the coast of Western Australia. The ""ghost"" shark was initially misidentified, and was only pegged as a new species after scientists took a second look at its bizarre egg cases that had languished in museum storage for years.

The newfound species, which was described in a new study published April 23 in the Journal of Fish Biology
(opens in new tab)
, has been named Apristurus ovicorrugatus, which is derived from the Latin for egg, ""ovi,"" and ""corrugatus,"" meaning corrugated, in reference to the corrugated egg cases that led to the species' discovery. 

The pregnant female, which was caught in 1992 and held in a museum collection, was carrying a single egg case.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

Along with its unique egg cases, A. ovicorrugatus also possesses unusual, shiny white irises.

""This is not a common feature for a deepwater species and only one other species, Apristurus nakayai from New Caledonia and PNG [Papua New Guinea] shares this character,"" study lead author Will White
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), told Live Science in an email.

Apristurus is a genus of catshark. They are commonly known as ghost or demon catsharks
(opens in new tab)
. It is one of the most diverse shark genera in the world, with around 40 known species. 

While the majority of shark species give birth to live young, the rest are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. The egg cases — also known as mermaid's purses — often have long tendrils that allow them to attach to seaweed or rocks.

In 2011, researchers came across an extremely strange egg case
(opens in new tab)
 containing a shark embryo. It was clear the shark belonged to the Apristurus genus, but the egg case did not match any known species. 

For over a decade, the egg case remained a mystery, until scientists found two more sitting in the Australian National Fish Collection, which falls under the CSIRO umbrella. 

""The egg cases possessed very distinctive longitudinal ridges on their surfaces which were T-shaped in cross-section,"" White said. ""Only one other species in the world has been found to have egg cases with that form of ridging and that is a different genus entirely."" 

A late-term embryo was found inside one of the egg cases examined.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

White and his colleagues then trawled through their collection database to see if any other unidentified Apristurus specimens had been found in the small region where the egg cases had been collected. They eventually found the pregnant female: a 1.5 foot-long (46.7 centimeters) shark that had been misidentified as a South China catshark (Apristurus sinensis). 

The female was carrying a single egg case — and it matched the one they'd found a decade ago.

""Luckily the female specimen we found contained an identically ridged egg case and confirmed our suspicions,"" White said. 

Researchers say the discovery of A. ovicorrugatus highlights the importance of egg case shape to identifying species. In Australia, members of the public are invited to upload images of egg cases to a global database

, allowing scientists to better understand where egg-laying sharks are breeding. The A. ovicorrugatus egg cases were found attached to corals, suggesting the species may rely on these organisms for reproduction.

Going forward, White and colleagues are scouring museum collections for more new species to see what else curators have overlooked or misidentified.

"2 days ago","Even mild concussions can 'rewire' the brain, possibly causing long-term symptoms","After a mild concussion, parts of the brain can become ""hyperconnected,"" and this may contribute to patients' long-lasting symptoms.","Gary Neville of the Manchester United Football Club holds his head after a collision with Dion Dublin of Aston Villa during a match held in March 2003. (Image credit: Offside / Contributor via Getty Images)

Even light bumps on the head can cause long-term problems, and researchers may now have an idea why: The brain's wiring can change in the aftermath of mild concussions.   

Prior studies suggested that even mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that don't cause any observable structural damage can still trigger symptoms that persist for more than six months. These symptoms range from problems with concentration and fatigue to depression and anxiety. 

Now, Rebecca Woodrow
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student at the University of Cambridge's Division of Anaesthesia, and her colleagues report that there can sometimes be an increase in the connectivity of the brain immediately after mild TBI that may help to predict and explain these long-lasting symptoms.

An estimated 50 million new TBI cases
(opens in new tab)
 are reported worldwide each year and this figure has been increasing. The trend prompted scientists to launch CENTER-TBI, a European Union-funded project aimed at improving care for TBI patients.  

Related: Concussions damage the 'bridge' between the two halves of the brain 

The recent study, published in February in the journal Brain
(opens in new tab)
, used CENTER-TBI data and found that, even for mild TBI, in which the patient is expected to make a full recovery within six months, problems often persist beyond that point.

""We were surprised at how many of these patients have a poor outcome,"" Woodrow, the study's first author, told Live Science. ""It was almost half."" 

Although there are treatments available for patients in intensive care for moderate to severe TBI, the understanding of mild TBI and its long-lasting symptoms remains poor, Woodrow said, adding, ""There is limited care for those symptoms, little support for these patients."" 

The brain changes identified in the new study hint at a way of identifying which patients will likely suffer long-lasting symptoms, as well as possible targets for drugs that may aid the recovery.

Woodrow and colleagues analyzed data from 108 TBI patients and 76 controls. This data included not just standard MRI and CT scans, which show brain structure, but also functional MRI (fMRI) scans, which provide data about brain function and are not usually collected for mild TBI. fMRI reveals the regions that have activity levels changing in sync, which are then inferred to be functionally connected. 

The CENTER-TBI dataset is unique because, in addition to brain scans, it includes behavioral data, clinical outcomes and biomarkers, co-senior author Emmanuel Stamatakis
(opens in new tab)
, whose University of Cambridge lab specializes in developing methods to understand fMRI data, told Live Science in an email. ""This makes it feasible to relate brain function to observed behaviour,"" he said.

Although the CT and standard MRI scans didn't reveal structural changes in the TBI patients' brains, the fMRIs showed significantly higher connectivity between the thalamus and the rest of the brain, compared with the healthy controls.  

Related: This blood test can detect brain injuries, but some doctors say it might be pointless

The thalamus is often described as the ""relay"" of the brain because many signals pass through the structure before being shuttled elsewhere. The thalamus is involved in not only primary sensory functions, such as seeing and smelling, but also various complex functions that activate multiple brain regions simultaneously, like concentrating, Woodrow said.

It may be that the brain adapts to injury in other areas of the brain by increasing their connections to the thalamus. Woodrow pointed out that the thalamus' position at the center of the brain also makes it vulnerable to injury from impacts, whatever direction they come from, so the increased connectivity could also be a response to direct thalamus injury.

Increased connectivity across the brain has already been identified in moderate and severe TBI, and in their new study, the authors noted that several past
(opens in new tab)
 studies
(opens in new tab)
 ""support this adaptive hyperconnectivity hypothesis."" 

""We can't claim to fully understand why it happens yet,"" said Stamatakis. Some scientists theorize that, immediately after mild TBI, the brain becomes hyperconnected, but that connectivity later dwindles and becomes lower than usual, in the long-term. 

But Woodrow explained that in mild TBI, it was thought that such hyperconnectivity effects may be much subtler than that seen in severe TBI and not significantly different from the varying connectivity levels normally seen from person to person. Past fMRI studies of mild injuries used small sample sizes of around 20 to 40 people, which limited their ability to identify a trend above baseline noise. 

The current study includes ""the largest sample studied with resting-state functional MRI in mild injury,"" Stamatakis said.

The study showed that not only is it possible to identify connectivity changes in the wake of mild TBI, but that regions where this hyperconnectivity is most prominent correlate with particular symptom types, such as emotional versus cognitive. These connectivity changes also correlate with concentrations of chemical messengers, or ""neurotransmitters"" in these brain regions. The study authors suggest that modulating these neurotransmitters could be a fruitful target for developing drugs to treat mild TBI.

Next, the researchers plan to look at the effects of repetitive concussion, as often seen in sports, to see whether TBI has cumulative effects that could make the consequences of concussion increasingly serious with each knock to the head.

The latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro chip is up to $250 off at Amazon right now.

Apple's MacBook machines are great, but they come with a price tag to match so it pays to be on the lookout for deals. Speaking of which...

Head on over to Amazon, and you can save $250 on the MacBook Pro M2 16-inch with 512GB storage
(opens in new tab)
, down to just $2249.99. If you need more storage, you can also save $200 on the MacBook Pro M2 with a 1TB SSD
(opens in new tab)
, down to $2499.99.

That's up to $250 off of the updated version of a laptop we called the best laptop for coding thanks to its power and efficiency - not bad at all.

MacBook Pro M2 Pro (16-inch) 512GB - was $2,499, now $2,249 at Amazon

Apple’s best-ever MacBook Pro offers the power of a desktop with a stunning display, and double the standard storage, and you can save $200.

The MacBook Pro 16-inch on offer here comes with the M2 Pro chip, which is not only powerful but flexible, too - it can even run many iPad and iPhone apps, alongside everything a Mac can do (which is a lot, by the way).

Apple Silicon also means a lot of the key internal components are embedded on the same chip, so less power is used transferring data between them. This results in a drastically improved battery life over the prior Intel-based models.

Add to that a return of ports (there's a MagSafe connector that supports fast-charging, three USB-C ports, HDMI output and an SD card slot) and the small matter of the best laptop screen we've tested and you've got a terrific all-rounder.

We've not yet reviewed the M2 Pro model, but in our MacBook Pro 16-inch review, we gave it our highest rating, 5 out of 5 stars, saying that: “the MacBook Pro 16-inch is a powerful and stylish laptop that's ideal for resource-intensive tasks like programming, coding, and video editing.”

Given the jump in power here in the same form factor, it's a great option for coding on the go.

It was long thought that pyrite — a shiny mineral also known as fool's gold — was the special ingredient that gave fossils embedded in Germany's Posidonia Shale their golden glow. But now scientists think something else is causing these fossils to shimmer.

Earlier this year, a team of international researchers visited the Early Jurassic site known for its exceptionally well-preserved fossils of marine animals. They collected dozens of samples of fossilized ammonites, bivalves and crustaceans that were about palm-size or larger. 

Once the team viewed the roughly 183 million-year-old fossils using a high-powered scanning electron microscope, they struggled to find any pyrite in the fossils poking out of the black shale, according to a study published in the March 2023 edition of the journal Earth-Science Reviews

""It was long believed that everything [at the Posidonia Shale] was pyritized,"" study co-author Rowan Martindale
(opens in new tab)
, an associate professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, told Live Science. ""We picked samples that we thought for sure would be all pyrite. And lo and behold there was a little bit of pyrite on a couple of them, but basically it was all phosphatized or yellow calcite. It was pretty much a shock to all of us who worked on the paper.""

After analyzing roughly 70 specimens, it was clear that while the shale surrounding the fossils was ""dotted with microscopic clusters of pyrite crystals, called framboids,"" it was phosphate minerals with yellow calcite that were the source of the fossils' golden glow, according to a statement

""The framboids look like tiny raspberries,"" study co-author Sinjini Sinha
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral candidate in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT, told Live Science. ""After looking at the specimens under a microscope, I only found a few framboids on the fossils themselves but counted 600 to 800 on the surrounding shale.""

Knowing that pyrite and phosphate are present in different parts of the specimens is crucial since it reveals information about the fossilization environment. For example, pyrite forms in anoxic environments where there's no oxygen present, whereas phosphate minerals like yellow calcite need oxygen to form, according to the statement.

The research revealed that even though an anoxic seafloor ""set the stage for fossilization,"" it took a burst of oxygen to cause the chemical reactions necessary for fossilization to occur. The oxygenation combined with the phosphate minerals helped turn the fossils into what looks like gold, according to the statement.

Hidden oceans may lurk under the icy crusts of four of Uranus' moons. 

Scientists recently reanalyzed data from the Voyager spacecraft that flew by Uranus in the 1980s and found that four of Uranus' largest moons — Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon — may be warm enough to host liquid oceans. In Titania and Oberon, these oceans might even be warm enough to potentially support life, according to a recent study in the Journal of Geophysical Research
(opens in new tab)
. 

""When it comes to small bodies — dwarf planets and moons — planetary scientists previously have found evidence of oceans in several unlikely places, including the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and Saturn's moon Mimas,"" study lead author Julie Castillo-Rogez
(opens in new tab)
 of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""So there are mechanisms at play that we don't fully understand.""

The new study integrated 1980s Voyager 2 data with information on other icy moons such as Pluto's Charon and Saturn's Enceladus drawn from more recent NASA missions such as Galileo, Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons. Uranus has 27 moons, but the researchers focused on the five largest, which are Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon and Miranda. Of these, Ariel is the smallest at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, while Titania is the largest at 980 miles (1,580 km) across.

Previously, scientists thought only Tatiana was likely to generate any internal heat via radioactive decay — the process by which unstable atoms lose energy through radiation — believing the other moons to be too small. However, modeling the other moons' porosity suggested that all but Miranda are insulated enough to retain internal heat created by radioactive decay. The researchers also found that any potential oceans beneath the icy crusts of these moons would be rich in chlorides, ammonia and salts, both of which would lower the freezing point of the water. The combination of a low freezing point and enough internal heat could mean that Ariel, Umbrial, Titania and Oberon all have oceans dozens of miles deep within their interiors, the researchers reported.

In 2020, scientists detected some evidence of recent geological activity on Ariel
(opens in new tab)
, suggesting the possible movement of a potential inner ocean. Miranda also has surface features that look relatively fresh, according to the researchers, but their modeling suggests that if the moon did have a liquid ocean at some point, it is likely frozen by now. 

To find out if these hidden oceans really exist, scientists will have to get creative. Spectrometers that can detect wavelengths of light reflected by ammonia and chlorides could help prove the presence of these chemicals under the crusts. Scientists could also use instruments that can detect electrical currents carried by liquid water to probe beneath these moons' surfaces. New modeling studies on how these moons formed could also help researchers plan what kind of observations they will need to make in the future, Castillo-Rogez said.

""We need to develop new models for different assumptions on the origin of the moons in order to guide planning for future observations,"" she said.

A child in Maine who recently tested positive for measles may be the state's first case of the viral infection since 2019, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reported Friday
(opens in new tab)
 (May 5).

While the case still needs to be confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Maine's public health agencies are assuming the child is infectious and working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed.

The CDC recommends
(opens in new tab)
 that children receive their first dose of the MMR vaccine, which guards against measles, mumps and rubella, between 12 months and 15 months old. Children should get their second dose between 4 and 6 years old. Alternatively, the MMRV vaccine, which also guards against varicella (chickenpox), may be given following the same vaccination schedule.

One dose of either vaccine is roughly 93% protective against measles, and two doses are 97% protective, meaning there's a small chance of infection even after two doses. However, vaccinated individuals tend to have much milder cases of the disease than unvaccinated people do.

The Maine child with a positive measles test had received one dose of a measles vaccine. (Neither the child's age nor any of their symptoms, if they had any, were noted in the DHHS statement.)

The Maine DHHS statement includes a list of locations that the measles-positive child recently visited and times they were at each place. ""Anyone at these locations during these times should watch for symptoms for 21 days after their exposure,"" the statement reads. ""If you have symptoms, call a health care provider for instructions before going to the office or hospital to help prevent further spread of infection.""

Between Jan. 1 and April 28, 2023, a total of 10 measles cases were reported nationwide, the CDC reported

(Image credit: Vestland County Municipality)

While playing outside her school in Norway, an 8-year-old girl found an unexpected treasure — not a lost ball or a discarded jump rope, but a flint dagger crafted by Stone Age people 3,700 years ago.

The student, identified only as Elise in a statement
(opens in new tab)
 translated from Norwegian, discovered the gray-brown dagger when she was playing in a rocky area by her school in Vestland County. ""I was going to pick up a piece of glass, and then the stone was there,"" she said in the statement. 

Elise showed the stone to her teacher, Karen Drange, who saw that the stone looked ancient. Drange contacted Vestland county council, and archaeologists from the county examined the artifact.

The nearly 5-inch-long (12 centimeters) tool is a rare find, Louise Bjerre Petersen
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist with Vestland county municipality, said in the translated statement. Flint, a hard sedimentary rock, does not naturally occur in Norway, so the dagger may have come from across the North Sea in Denmark, according to the statement.

The nearly 5-inch-long (12 centimeters) flint dagger was likely crafted during the Neolithic period about 3,700 years ago.  (Image credit: Vestland County Municipality)

This type of dagger is often found with sacrificial finds, the archaeologists added. To further investigate the area, the Vestland County Council and Vestland County's University Museum in Bergen, Norway's second-largest city, teamed up to explore the school's grounds. But they didn't find any other evidence dating back to the Stone Age, they said in the statement.

Based on its style, the dagger likely dates to the New Stone Age, or the Neolithic, a time when prehistoric humans shaped stone tools
(opens in new tab)
 and began to rely on domesticated plants and animals, build permanent villages and develop crafts, such as pottery. In Norway, the Stone Age, which includes the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, lasted from 10000 B.C. to 1800 B.C., with a number of hunter-gatherers permanently settling down to farm around 2400 B.C., according to Talk Norway
(opens in new tab)
, an educational website on Norway's history and cultural heritage.

The dagger will be cataloged and used in research at the University Museum. The artifact isn't the only Stone Age discovery to recently get attention in Norway. This past winter, the full-body reconstruction of a Stone Age teenager who lived 8,300 years ago went on display at the Hå Gamle Prestegard museum in southern Norway. The teen boy was likely part of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer group, but the details surrounding his death are a mystery; it appears he died alone leaning against a cave wall, as his remains had no indications of a burial.

Astronomers may have just found the remnants of some of the universe's very first stars. The chemical signatures of these faraway, 13-plus-billion-year-old objects are remarkably different from those of younger stars, like our sun. By studying them, scientists hope to shed light on how stars, galaxies and even basic elements form. 

The research, co-authored by University of Florence astrophysicist Stefania Salvadori
(opens in new tab)
, was published May 3 in The Astrophysical Journal
(opens in new tab)
. 

In the earliest days of the universe, only very simple elements such as hydrogen and helium were available. The first stars ignited from these elements alone. Over time, their white-hot cores gradually cooked simple atoms into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, magnesium and eventually metals. Later generations of stars formed from clouds of gas containing these heavier atoms, and today most of the stars scientists observe are rich in metals like iron. (Our sun is about 98% hydrogen and helium, but contains trace amounts of heavier elements like iron, neon and carbon.)

Nobody has observed the original metal-deficient stars directly; most of them probably fizzled out or exploded long ago. But scientists can still observe some of their dusty remains by setting their sights billions of light years away.

RELATED STORIES

—For the first time, scientists watched a dying star swallow a planet whole

—2 stars covered in unusual elements have a puzzling origin story

—The early universe was crammed with stars 10,000 times the size of our sun, new study suggests

Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), Salvadori and her team peered into three distant clouds of star-forming gas. On their own, these clouds wouldn't tell scientists very much, but incoming light from nearby quasars — extremely bright galactic cores formed by dust falling into a supermassive black hole — helped reveal the cloud's secrets. Based on which wavelengths of light the gas clouds absorbed, the team determined what elements the stellar remains were made of. 

Sure enough, the clouds were extremely poor in iron and other metallic elements, but rich in carbon, oxygen and magnesium — precisely what would have been left over after the first stars ran out of fuel and exploded, according to the researchers. This tracks with other research into the origins of stars, and may help explain the composition of younger stars, including those found in the Milky Way. 

""Our discovery opens new avenues to indirectly study the nature of the first stars, fully complementing studies of stars in our galaxy,"" Salvadori said in a statement

It's well known that the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin plays a key role in sleep. But other hormones, including the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone, can also affect our sleep — and potentially even our dreams. 

In particular, people may notice differences in the quality of their sleep and the way they dream at different stages of their menstrual cycle, experts told Live Science. Here's how the menstrual cycle might affect sleep and dreaming.

How the menstrual cycle affects sleep and dreams 

Sleep is broken down into stages, broadly known as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People dream during REM sleep, which usually begins about 90 minutes after a person falls asleep, said Dr. Tania Adib
(opens in new tab)
, a consultant gynecologist at The Lister Hospital in the U.K. 

NREM sleep is broken up into four stages: easily disturbed light sleep, a deeper intermediate sleep, and two stages of deep sleep, which occurs just before REM sleep, according to the Mayo Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. Deep sleep is the most restorative and where the body and brain have time to repair.

Estrogen and progesterone can affect how much time people spend in REM and NREM sleep and whether they wake up often while dreaming.

""There are lots of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the parts of the brain that regulate sleep, and because the levels of these hormones change during the menstrual cycle, it means our sleep also varies across the month,"" said Dr. Zoe Schaedel
(opens in new tab)
, co-founder of Myla Health, a private clinic for women experiencing menopause, perimenopause and reproductive health issues in England. 

The menstrual cycle has four stages: menses (when the period occurs), the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, according to the Cleveland Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. The menstrual cycle ""begins"" on the first day of a period. Prior to ovulation, which occurs roughly around day 14, estrogen levels rise, Schaedel told Live Science. ""Sleep tends to be better-quality in this phase, known as the follicular or proliferative phase.""  

After ovulation, progesterone levels then begin to rise and eventually overtake estrogen; if a pregnancy doesn't occur, the levels of both hormones drop in the lead-up to menstration. ""This is known as the 'luteal phase' and is where we see changes in the structure of sleep,"" Schaedel said.

Shifting progesterone levels during the luteal phase may partly cause disturbed sleep in the lead-up to a person's period, Schaedel said. 

Compared to estrogen, progesterone is thought to be more strongly tied to premenstrual symptoms (PMS), which occur during the luteal phase and commonly include insomnia or oversleeping, according to Mount Sinai.
(opens in new tab)
 These sleep changes aren't fully understood, but rising progesterone in the luteal phase is linked to increased body temperatures and sweating
(opens in new tab)
, which may interfere with sleep because normally, body temperatures decline before and during sleep. The overall ratio of REM to NREM sleep may also decrease during this phase, according to a 2021 review in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience
(opens in new tab)
. 

RELATED STORIES

—Do dreams really reveal our deepest secrets?

—Does the moon affect menstrual cycles?

—Why can't we remember our dreams?

Progesterone and estrogen help modulate chemical messengers in the brain — namely, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) — which regulate mood and stress levels, according to Mount Sinai. Anxiousness and depressed mood due to PMS may undermine people's attempts to fall asleep
(opens in new tab)
, and physical symptoms, like body aches and nausea, may also help explain why people experiencing PMS are prone to sleep disruptions, per the Frontiers in Neuroscience review. 

Melatonin production and sensitivity may also change during the luteal phase, some studies hint, but the research is ""not sufficient""
(opens in new tab)
 to draw strong conclusions.

Sleep disturbances in the luteal phase may increase the likelihood that individuals remember their vivid dreams, Schaedel said. 

""If sleep fragments REM, or you wake up shortly after the REM stage, you are far more likely to remember your dreams,"" Adib told Live Science.

One 2019 study hinted that hormones may also affect the types of dreams a person has
(opens in new tab)
. The study asked hundreds of women to recall the previous night's dreams. Of the women who could remember, those in the luteal phase more often reported their dreams as being ""pleasant,"" while those in other parts of the menstrual cycle were more likely to report their dreams being ""unpleasant."" 

However, it's unclear whether this result would carry over to other, larger groups of people.

A school of piranhas attacked holiday makers playing in a stream in a Brazilian resort on May 1, leaving at least eight people injured.

The fish tore at the bathers' legs and feet with their razor-sharp teeth, driving them out of the water and onto a tourist beach in Tarumã-Açu, a region northeast of Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazonas.

Experts think the biting frenzy was a case of ""mistaken identity"" and that the piranhas were actually after the food that visitors at local restaurants sometimes throw into the river.

""Piranhas do not exhibit unprovoked attacks on humans,"" Steve Huskey

, a professor of biology at Western Kentucky University, told Live Science in an email. ""The situation described is one of piranhas becoming acclimated to free food and those bites were just another example of mistaken identity, just like shark attacks.""

Some piranha species, including the red-bellied piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), engage in collective feeding frenzies. ""Species of the genus Pygocentrus, that occur in the Amazon and São Francisco river drainages, are most dangerous,"" Paulo Andreas Buckup

Most piranhas are harmless and the meat-eating species tend to scavenge rather than hunt living animals. ""Some species of the piranha family eat only fruit, insects and vegetable matter. Some specialize in eating fish scales and nibbling the fins of other fish,"" Buckup said. ""They may attack other live fish or animals, but they will eat dead flesh whenever it is available.""

The presence of bathers in a feeding spot, however, can lead to confusion and aggression. ""Feeding piranhas in a tourist setting strengthens their natural behaviors to school and bite,"" Mark Sabaj Perez
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, Philadelphia, told Live Science in an email.

The attack in Tarumã-Açu could have been triggered by a single piranha mistaking a foot for food, taking a mouthful and drawing blood, which in turn sparked a feeding frenzy. ""An attack is likely to have been caused by presence of blood in the water, skin injuries or movement that appears as a fish in distress,"" Buckup said. ""Because their teeth are so sharp, a single bite [could] cause a lot of bleeding and trigger group feeding frenzy behavior.""

Once the meal begins, piranhas dart in and out to bite their prey at great speed to avoid being accidentally nipped by another individual, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium.

Piranhas have the strongest bite recorded in bony fish — as powerful as a great white shark, according to a 2012 study published in the journal Scientific Reports

""When a piranha focuses that bite force onto their 14 razor-sharp teeth, the bite pressure climbs to immeasurable levels,"" Huskey said. ""They could do tremendous damage to humans throughout South America, if they were so inclined, but they're not… and they don't.""

A rock likely to be a meteorite crashed into a New Jersey home on Monday (May 8), damaging a bedroom but causing no injuries. 

No one was at Suzy Kop's home in Hopewell Township, New Jersey, when the space rock made its entrance, according to CBS News Philadelphia
(opens in new tab)
, which first reported the unusual event. The meteorite landed around 1 p.m. EDT, crashing through the roof and landing in the bedroom belonging to Kop's father. Judging by the damage, the meteorite hit the floor, bounced to the ceiling, and came to rest in the corner of a room. The metallic rock measures about 4 inches by 6 inches (10 by 15 centimeters). 

""I did touch the thing because I thought it was a random rock… and it was warm,"" Kop told CBS News.

Authorities are still investigating the origin of the apparent space rock, but Derrick Pitts
(opens in new tab)
, the chief astronomer at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, told CBS News that it could be four to five billion years old. It’s possible that the meteorite was part of the ongoing Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which roughly occurs between April 19 and May 29 each year, and which reached its peak around May 5 and 6. During peak days, the shower can produce hundreds of ""shooting stars"" per hour – most of which are meteors that burn up in the atmosphere. These meteors are the rocky debris left by Halley’s Comet, which becomes visible from Earth every 75 to 79 years, according to NASA

""For it to actually strike a house, for people to be able to pick up, that's really unusual and has happened very few times in history,"" Pitts said.

In February 2013, a meteor estimated at 59 feet (18 m) in diameter zinged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia.

(Image credit: EmirMemedovski via Getty Images)

Sleep apnea may be linked to certain indicators of worse brain health, according to a new study.

The study, published Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Neurology
(opens in new tab)
, looked at people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition where the upper throat muscles relax during sleep and block the airway. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sleep studies to examine if sleep apnea and altered sleep were associated with two kinds of unusual patterns in the brain's white matter — the insulated wires that extend from brain cells.

Both severe sleep apnea and reduced time spent in the deep stages of sleep were associated with these two biomarkers, which have each previously been linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or general cognitive decline, as well as having a stroke.

The researchers found ""a pretty significant association between slow-wave sleep duration, or deep sleep time, and these white matter measures,"" said Bryce Mander
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.

Related: Human brain looks years 'older' after just one night without sleep, small study shows 

The study included 140 people with OSA whose average age was about 73 years old. All the participants were screened for one of the two biomarkers, but only 103 were screened for the second, as well. The overall group was relatively evenly split between people with mild, moderate and severe OSA, and most people had no cognitive impairment during the study.

One of the biomarkers that the researchers looked for in brain scans were white matter hyperintensities, ""bright spots commonly seen in the white matter of the brain on MRI, which appear with aging and vascular disease,"" Dr. Diego Carvalho
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine and the senior author of the study, wrote in an email to Live Science. ""They represent areas of damage to the white matter.""

The second biomarker, called ""fractional anisotropy of the genu of the corpus callosum,"" is related to how water flows through brain cells' wires, or axons. Changes in this water flow, wrote Carvalho, are related to axon damage and can be an early sign of vascular disease. The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain and contains the organ's densest white matter. 

Using polysomnography, meaning the variety of data collected during a sleep study, the researchers found that participants who spent less time in slow-wave sleep appeared more affected by both types of biomarkers in their MRIs. Separately, people with severe OSA also appeared more impacted by white matter abnormalities than people with mild or moderate OSA. 

The research reveals associations between sleep apnea, deep sleep, and white matter abnormalities, but it can't say whether these sleep differences caused the abnormalities, or if differences in white matter could be interfering with sleep. It also could be that sleep and white matter abnormalities impact one another, said Mander, contributing to a vicious cycle of poor sleep quality and worse brain health.

""To me, I think that's the most likely outcome,"" he said.

One limitation of the study is that polysomnography data was only collected for the first few hours participants slept; people's sleep patterns might have differed later in the night. After their sleep study, anyone who met criteria for sleep apnea was given treatment in the form of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which can help keep the airway open. Carvalho said that data from this ""treatment phase"" wasn't included because differences in how people responded to the CPAP would have muddied the data.

MRIs and polysomnography were taken, on average, about 1.7 years apart, but researchers only collected each type of data at one point in time, offering only snapshots of patients' brains and sleep patterns and not how they might change over time. The study also did not follow participants to see who might go on to develop dementia.  

Mander said that future research should examine how sleep apnea's impact on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage of sleep when most dreaming happens, might affect the brain. (Slow-wave sleep occurs in certain stages of non-REM sleep.) However, the new study introduces important ideas about ""how sleep apnea and sleep disturbance might be associated with cognitive decline,"" he said.

"about 22 hours ago","1st draft of a human 'pangenome' published, adding millions of 'building blocks' to the human reference genome","A new version of the human reference genome incorporates genetic data from 47 individuals from around the globe, deepening scientists' view into how genes work.","A new human reference ""pangenome"" includes DNA data from 47 people. (Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)

Scientists have published the first human ""pangenome"" — a full genetic sequence that incorporates genomes from not just one individual, but 47. 

These 47 individuals hail from around the globe and thus vastly increase the diversity of the genomes represented in the sequence, compared to the previous full human genome sequence that scientists use as their reference for study. The first human genome sequence was released with some gaps in 2003 and only made ""gapless"" in 2022. If that first human genome is a simple linear string of genetic code, the new pangenome is a series of branching paths.

The ultimate goal of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, which published the first draft of the pangenome on Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Nature
(opens in new tab)
, is to sequence at least 350 individuals from different populations around the world. Although 99.9% of the genome is the same from person to person, there is a lot of diversity found in that final 0.1%.

""Rather than using a single genome sequence as our coordinate system, we should instead have a representation that is based on the genomes of many different people so we can better capture genetic diversity in humans,"" Melissa Gymrek
(opens in new tab)
, a genetics researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the project, told Live Science. 

Related: More than 150 'made-from-scratch' genes are in the human genome. 2 are totally unique to us. 

The newly drafted human pangenome is a collection of different genomes from which to compare an individual genome sequence. Like a map of the subway system, the pangenome graph has many possible routes for a sequence to take, represented by the different colors.   The detouring paths at the top of the image represent single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which are single letter differences. The yellow path that loops around itself and repeats the same nucleotides represents a duplication variant. The pink path that loops counterclockwise and follows the nucleotide sequence backwards represents an inversion variant. At the bottom, the green and dark blue paths miss the C nucleotide in its route and represent a deletion variant. The light blue path, which has extra nucleotides in its route, represents an insertion variant. (Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)
A reference for health 

The first full human genome sequence was completed in 2003 by the Human Genome Project and was based on one person's DNA. Later, bits and pieces from about 20 other individuals were added, but 70% of the sequence scientists use to benchmark genetic variation still comes from a single person. 

Geneticists use the reference genome as a guide when sequencing pieces of people's genetic codes, Arya Massarat
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student in Gymrek's lab who co-authored an editorial about the new research with her in the journal Nature, told Live Science. They match the newly decoded DNA snippets to the reference to figure out how they fit within the genome as a whole. They also use the reference genome as a standard to pinpoint genetic variations — different versions of genes that diverge from the reference — that might be linked with health conditions. 

But with a single reference mostly from one person, scientists have only a limited window of genetic diversity to study.

The first pangenome draft now doubles the number of large genome variants, known as structural variants, that scientists can detect, bringing them up to 18,000. These are places in the genome where large chunks have been deleted, inserted or rearranged. The new draft also adds 119 million new base pairs, meaning the paired ""letters"" that make up the DNA sequence, and 1,115 new gene duplication mutations to the previous version of the human genome.

""It really is understanding and cataloging these differences between genomes that allow us to understand how cells operate and their biology and how they function, as well as understanding genetic differences and how they contribute to understanding human disease,"" study co-author Karen Miga
(opens in new tab)
, a geneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said at a press conference held May 9. 

The pangenome could help scientists get a better grasp of complex conditions in which genes play an influential role, such as autism, schizophrenia, immune disorders and coronary heart disease, researchers involved with the study said at the press conference. 

For example, the Lipoprotein A gene is known to be one of the biggest risk factors for coronary heart disease in African Americans, but the specific genetic changes involved are complex and poorly understood, study co-author Evan Eichler
(opens in new tab)
, a genomics researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, told reporters. With the pangenome, researchers can now more thoroughly compare the variation in people with heart disease and without, and this could help clarify individuals' risk of heart disease based on what variants of the gene they carry. 

Related: As little as 1.5% of our genome is 'uniquely human'  

A diverse understanding 

The current pangenome draft used data from participants in the 1000 Genomes Project, which was the first attempt to sequence genomes from a large number of people from around the world. The included participants had agreed for their genetic sequences to be anonymized and included in publicly available databases. 

The new study also used advanced sequencing technology called ""long-read sequencing,"" as opposed to the short-read sequencing that came before. Short-read sequencing is what happens when you send your DNA to a company like 23andMe, Eichler said. Researchers read out small segments of DNA and then stitch them together into a whole. This kind of sequencing can capture a decent amount of genetic variation, but there can be poor overlap between each DNA fragment. Long-read sequencing, on the other hand, captures big segments of DNA all at once.

—Smallest genome of living creature discovered 

While it's possible to sequence a genome with short-read sequencing for about $500, long-read sequencing is still expensive, costing about $10,000 a genome, Eichler said. The price is coming down, however, and the pangenome team hopes to sequence their next batches of genomes at half that cost or less. 

The researchers are working to recruit new participants to continue to fill in diversity gaps in the pangenome, study co-author Eimear Kenny
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of medicine and genetics at  the Institute for Genomic Health at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told reporters. Because genetic information is sensitive and because different rules govern data-sharing and privacy in different countries, this is delicate work. Issues include privacy, informed consent, and the possibility of discrimination based on genetic information, Kenny said. 

Already, researchers are uncovering new genetic processes with the draft pangenome. In two papers published in Nature alongside the work, researchers looked at highly repetitive segments of the genome. These segments have traditionally been difficult to study, biochemist Brian McStay
(opens in new tab)
 of the National University of Ireland Galway, told Live Science, because sequencing them via short-read technology makes it hard to understand how they fit together. The long read technology allows for long chunks of these repetitive sequences to be read at once. 

The studies found that in one type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
, known as segmental duplications, there is a larger than expected amount of variation, potentially a mechanism for the long-term evolution of new functions for genes. In another type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
 that is responsible for building the cellular machines that create new proteins, though, the genome stays remarkably stable. The pangenome allowed researchers to discover a potential mechanism for how these key segments of DNA stay consistent over time.

""This is just the start,"" McStay said. ""There will be a whole lot of new biology that will come out of this.""

Humpback whales have — for the first time ever — been filmed rolling to and fro on sandy seabeds to scrub off dead skin and unwanted hitchhikers.

Footage captured by researchers in the Gold Coast Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia, shows the gigantic marine mammals performing full and side ""sand rolls"" up to 164 feet (50 meters) below the ocean's surface to shed parasites that live on their skin, known as ectoparasites, which can make the whales less hydrodynamic.

""We believe that the whales exfoliate using the sand to assist with molting and removal of ectoparasites, such as barnacles, and specifically select areas suitable for this behavior,"" Olaf Meynecke

, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia who led the research, said in a statement

Although humpback whales have been spotted hovering and feeding near the seafloor before, this is the first time researchers have recorded them rolling in the sand. A 2016 study published in the journal Marine Biodiversity Records
(opens in new tab)
 suggested that humpbacks used the seabed for hygienic purposes, but the reported sightings were opportunistic and made from a boat rather than underwater.

Barnacles are sturdy little crustaceans related to lobsters and shrimp. They cement themselves to other sea creatures with one of the most powerful known natural glues, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ocean Service
(opens in new tab)
. Whales need to remove these crusty parasites to stay streamlined and preserve energy, according to a study describing the sand rolling behavior, published March 12 in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering
(opens in new tab)
.

The whales picked a shallow, sandy location near their migration route to exfoliate, moving head first through the substrate while they rolled. The density of parasites is generally higher around the face than elsewhere, so getting rid of them requires a rigorous rub, according to the study.

The researchers tagged three humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) between August 2021 and October 2022 using suction-cup sensors that recorded high-definition video, as well as light, pressure, temperature and GPS data. The animals were on their summer migration path from tropical breeding grounds near the Great Barrier Reef, to cooler feeding grounds in Antarctica.

While they cannot exclude the possibility that the whales were trying to scratch off the tags, the researchers note that other individuals that were not tagged were also seen rolling across the seabed in the new footage. The tagged humpbacks also did not seem to be targeting the skin carrying the sensors.

The whale exfoliation also provided a tasty snack for small fish called silver trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus), which were seen feeding on dead skin flakes just after the sand rolls.

As well as staying streamlined, exfoliating on the seabed could help humpbacks maintain healthy skin. 

""Humpback whales host diverse communities of skin bacteria that can pose a threat for open wounds if bacteria grow in large numbers,"" Meynecke said. ""Removing excess skin is likely a necessity to maintain a healthy bacterial skin community."" Humpbacks remove some barnacles and skin via breaches — where a whale leaps from the water — but not all, he said.

Rolling around could also be a social activity related to play or relaxation. ""During the different deployments, the sand rolling was observed in the context of socializing,"" Meynecke said. ""The behavior was either following courtship, competition or other forms of socializing."" Other whale species, including bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) are known to rub against rocks, pebbles and mud on the seafloor to shed excess skin.

If you're looking for a quality fitness tracker for yourself or a family member, and want to save some money, we've found a great Fitbit Charge 5 deal for you. Amazon have knocked a fantastic 32% off the retail price
(opens in new tab)
, bringing this best Fitbit down to $102: there has never been a better time to join the Fitbit club!

We've tested this model extensively, and you can read our Fitbit Charge 5 review to get a better understanding of what it's all about. If you just want to know if it's any good... well, it is listed in our guide to the best fitness trackers — and for good reason. The Fitbit model comes with full GPS, an ECG feature, and it's one of the few Fitbits that has a clever EDA sensor, which can measure stress. The only other models that offer this are the more high-end trackers in Fitbit's range, like the Versa and the Sense, which right now cost around $100 more.

If you're not convinced whether you want a Charge 5 or a different Fitbit altogether, we've done some handy comparisons to help you decide: Fitbit Charge 4 vs Charge 5 and Fitbit Inspire 3 vs Fitbit Charge 5.

Fitbit Charge 5 | Was $149.95, Now $102.00 on Amazon
Save a brilliant 32% on one of the top fitness trackers on the market. Coming with a 7-day battery life, built-in GPS, advanced health features like an ECG and EDA function along with the ability to track your sleep, this stellar fitness band is suitable for most people. 

VIEW DEAL

Our favorite features of this model are the sleep tracking options, the heart rate monitor, built-in GPS, and the handy stress management sensor. 

Plus, if you do take the plunge but decide that the Fitbit Charge 5 isn't right for you (or your loved one), you can always return the wearable, as long as it hasn't been used. 

Here at Live Science, we've tried and tested many great fitness trackers and some of the best running watches for both the US and UK markets, from the likes of Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit. 

So we speak from experience when we say that the Charge 5 is one of the best models for anyone looking to pick up their first fitness tracker. It has all the features you need to really hone both your fitness and wellness routine, without breaking the bank. The band comes in three different colors: graphite black, lunar white and steel blue, so it'll suit most workout outfits.

We appreciate some of the enhanced personal safety features too, like the GPS, which allows for phone-free route tracking; and the ECG sensor which analyses your heart rhythm to check for abnormalities. But if we're honest, it's the impressive EDA stress sensor that Fitbit introduced into the watch that makes it stand out from the crowd. Who wouldn't want to track and stay on top of their stress levels?

It does also come with blood oxygenation readings and fitness plans. If you pay the $102 price tag today, the watch includes a 6-month Fitbit Premium trial, although you'll need to pay an extra $9.99 a month thereafter to access these features.

Shark attacks are extremely rare
(opens in new tab)
 — you're unlikely to meet one in the flesh, let alone be bitten. But during World War II, the sinking of a U.S. Navy ship led to one of the most infamous shark attacks in history and the deaths of hundreds of men, with the explosion drawing in the apex predators and sparking a feeding frenzy that lasted for days.

In July 1945, the USS Indianapolis had completed a trip to a naval base on the Pacific island of Tinian to deliver uranium and other components that would be used to create the atomic bomb ""Little Boy."" The first nuclear weapon ever used in wartime, it would later be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

After delivering the parts, the Indianapolis departed for the Philippines on training duty. Shortly after midnight on July 30, the ship was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, causing massive damage. It began to take on huge amounts of water, and sank in just 12 minutes. Of the 1,195 men
(opens in new tab)
 on board, around 300 went down with the ship, but nearly 900 were left adrift in the open ocean.

Many died of exposure, dehydration and saltwater poisoning. However, according to Smithsonian Magazine, up to 150 sailors and crew are estimated to have been killed by sharks — in what is considered the worst shark attack in history. But why?

Dangerous sharks and how they hunt

Unlike some other predators, such as lions and wolves, most sharks hunt alone, Nico Booyens, a marine biologist and director of research at the Shark Research Unit
(opens in new tab)
 in South Africa, told Live Science in an email. ""Different shark species have different hunting techniques, but many sharks are solitary predators that rely on their senses of sight, smell and electroreception to locate their prey.""

Sharks also have a special system called a lateral line
(opens in new tab)
 that picks up the vibrations in the water, Booyens says. This sensory ability would have allowed them to detect the movement of the men in the water as they thrashed around to stay afloat. Once the sharks had located the sailors, they stood little chance of survival — especially those who were injured.

Related: In rare attack, great white shark decapitates diver in Mexico. But why?

According to survivor accounts, many victims were attacked near the surface of the water. This has since led to suggestions that oceanic whitetip sharks
(opens in new tab)
 (Carcharhinus longimanus) were the involved in the attacks because they are a surface-dwelling species
(opens in new tab)
.

""When a shark has located its prey, it will often use its sharp teeth and powerful jaws to bite and tear chunks of flesh from the prey,"" Booyens added. ""Some sharks, like the tiger shark [Galeocerdo cuvier], are known for their ability to swallow their prey whole, while others, like the bull shark [Carcharhinus leucas], will attack and bite their prey repeatedly until it is weakened or immobilized.""

Although oceanic whitetips are at the top of the food chain, their meals can be few and far between, so they are often opportunistic feeders. According to the Florida Museum
(opens in new tab)
, the species is often the first to appear at the site of oceanic disasters, and was also a major cause of fatalities after the sinking of the RMS Nova Scotia in 1942. The species is known to be persistent, unpredictable and shows little fear, making it particularly dangerous to humans, the Florida Museum said.

The worst shark attack in history 

Oceanic whitetip sharks was a major cause of concern for downed planes and sunken ships during World War II and is often the first species at the scene of ocean disasters.  (Image credit: atese/Getty Images)

At the USS Indianapolis, the bodies of the dead and the injured were picked off first. Survivor Corporal Edgar Harrell told the Indianapolis Star
(opens in new tab)
 in 2014: ""That first morning, we had sharks."" As men got separated they would be targeted,"" he explained. ""You hear a blood-curdling scream. And then the body would go under, and then that life vest popped back up.""

The men were too scared to eat or move, for fear of being preyed upon. According to the report of a survivor, one of the sailors opened a can of Spam, the primary ration at the time, but was surrounded by sharks, resulting in a ""feeding frenzy.""

""Feeding frenzies typically occur when there is a sudden abundance of food, such as when a large school of fish is trapped in a small area,"" Booyens said. ""The scent of blood and the thrashing of prey can trigger a feeding frenzy, causing sharks to swarm and compete for the available food.""

The survivors of the USS Indianapolis were at sea for four days before rescue teams arrived.  (Image credit: PhotoQuest/Getty Images)

Many species of shark may engage in frenzied hunting, during which they can become very aggressive and attack each other as well as the prey. However, oceanic whitetips’ opportunistic feeding behavior — as well as their size and strength — made them particularly dangerous for the sailors. ""Feeding frenzies can be dangerous for humans who happen to be in the water, as the sharks may not be able to distinguish between prey and people,"" Booyens added.

For four days, no rescue arrived. Although the U.S. Navy had received word that a Japanese submarine had sunk a U.S. vessel, the message was believed to be fake — in an attempt to lure American rescue boats into a trap. Meanwhile, the survivors tried to stay alive by floating in groups, but in the scorching heat, many succumbed to dehydration. Others died from hypernatremia — too much sodium in the blood — from being forced to drink the salty seawater.

Eventually, a Navy plane flying overhead spotted the Indianapolis survivors and radioed for help. Food, water and rafts were dropped for the surviving men, before a seaplane was landed by Lt. Adrian Marks to rescue some of the survivors from the sharks. Finally, the USS Cecil J. Doyle helped to pull the remaining survivors from the water. Only 316 men survived.

(Image credit: SrdjanPav via Getty Images)

Ice age groups in the ancient northern coast of China helped make up the first wave of people to settle the New World, a new DNA study suggests.

The ancient groups may have also migrated to Japan, potentially helping explain similarities in Stone Age artifacts in the Americas, China and Japan, according to the study, published Tuesday (May 9) in the journal Cell Reports
(opens in new tab)
.

There are two leading models as to how people first migrated to the Americas. The older idea suggests that ancient Siberians made this journey when the Bering Land Bridge — the landmass that once connected Asia with North America — was relatively free of ice. More recent evidence argues that multiple waves of humans journeyed to the Americas from various parts of Eurasia, perhaps on watercraft along the Pacific coasts of Asia, the Bering Land Bridge and North America.

To shed light on the origins of Indigenous Americans, scientists examined DNA from mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria possess their own genes, which are passed down from the mother.

The researchers analyzed more than 100,000 contemporary and 15,000 ancient DNA samples from across Eurasia. They focused on a rare mitochondrial DNA lineage called D4h, which is currently found in only about 1 in 200 people worldwide.

, a molecular anthropologist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China, told Live Science in an email. ""Therefore, this female lineage, as well as its origin and dispersal history — especially its dispersal into the Americas — gained little attention until now."" 

Previous research
(opens in new tab)
 found that one branch of D4h, known as D4h3a, was seen in Indigenous Americans, while another offshoot named D4h3b was detected in China and Thailand. This suggested that ancient members of the D4h lineage might help bridge Asia and the Americas.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (26,500 to 19,000 years ago), ice age humans with the maternal lineage D4h3a left Asia and likely crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

""The most difficult work was to collect as many samples belonging to D4h as we could,"" study senior author Qing-Peng Kong
(opens in new tab)
, an evolutionary geneticist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, told Live Science in an email.

By comparing mutations seen in mitochondrial DNA over time, as well as the geographic locations and radiocarbon dates of the fossils from which ancient DNA was collected, the scientists found D4h3a likely originated in northern coastal China.

""The ancestral sources of Native Americans in Asia are more complicated than previously indicated,"" Li said.

The new findings suggest that the ancestors and closest relatives of D4h3a entered the Americas through at least two migrations. Both diasporas apparently occurred when the land bridge from Asia to the Americas was obstructed by ice, so the researchers suggest that ice age people may have traveled via the Pacific coast instead. 

The first migration likely happened between 19,500 and 26,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest part of the last ice age, the researchers said. Back then, ice sheets covered much of the planet, and living in northern China would have likely proven difficult for humans.

During the last deglaciation (19,000 to 11,500 years ago), people from what is now northern China likely journeyed to Japan. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

The scientists estimated the second event apparently occurred between 19,000 and 11,500 years ago, when the ice sheets began melting. Prior work suggested this climate shift likely helped support the rapid growth seen in human populations during this era, which may have helped drive their spread into other regions.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that during the second wave, one lineage branched out from northern coastal China and traveled to Japan, where they contributed to the Japanese gene pool, especially the indigenous Ainu people. ""This points to an unexpected genetic link between Native Americans and the Japanese,"" Kong said.

In all, the new study ""matches well with what we know about the archaeological record of Japan, and lends weight to current models of how humans came to populate the Americas,"" Loren Davis
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis who did not take part in this research, told Live Science in an email.

This discovery may help explain some archeological similarities that prior work controversially suggested at times existed between Stone Age peoples in China, Japan and the Americas. Specifically, researchers had argued the three regions possessed similarities in how they crafted ""stemmed projectile points"" for arrowheads and spears. 

Although the scientists focused on mitochondrial DNA, additional genetic analyses they conducted suggest that male ancestors of Indigenous Americans also lived in northern China at about the same time as these female ancestors.

However, while the new study is exciting, it's just ""another piece of the puzzle,"" on how and when ice age humans first populated the Americas, Davis said. For instance, the researchers stressed that while these new findings suggest this single northern Chinese lineage may have contributed to Indigenous American ancestry, ""it does not represent the whole history of all Native Americans,"" Li said. ""Investigating other lineages showing genetic connections between Asia and the Americas will help obtain the whole picture of the history of Native Americans.""

Earth probably shouldn't exist. 

That's because the orbits of the inner solar system planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are chaotic, and models have suggested that these inner planets should have crashed into each other by now. And yet, that hasn't happened.

New research published May 3 in the journal Physical Review X
(opens in new tab)
 may finally explain why.

Through a deep plunge into the models for planetary motion, the researchers discovered that the motions of the inner planets are constrained by certain parameters that act as a tether that inhibits the system's chaos. Besides providing a mathematical explanation for the apparent harmony in our solar system, the new study's insights may help scientists understand the trajectories of exoplanets surrounding other stars. 

Unpredictable planets

Planets constantly exert a mutual gravitational pull on each other – and these little tugs constantly make minor adjustments to the planets' orbits. The outer planets, which are much larger, are more resistant to little tugs and so maintain comparatively stable orbits. 

The problem of inner planet trajectories, however, is still too complicated to solve exactly. In the late 19th century, mathematician Henri Poincaré proved that it is mathematically impossible to solve the equations governing the motion for three or more interacting objects, often known as the ""three body problem."" As a result, uncertainties in the details of the planets' starting positions and velocities balloon over time. In other words: It is possible to take two scenarios in which the distances between Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth differ by the slightest amount, and in one the planets smash into each other and in another they veer apart.

The time it takes for two trajectories with almost identical starting conditions to diverge by a specific amount is known as the Lyapunov time of the chaotic system. In 1989, Jacques Laskar
(opens in new tab)
, astronomer and research director at the National Center for Scientific Research and Paris Observatory and a co-author of the new study, calculated the characteristic Lyapunov time 
(opens in new tab)
for the planetary orbits of the inner solar system was just 5 million years. 

""It means basically that you lose one digit every 10 million years,"" Laskar, told Live Science. So, for example if the initial uncertainty in the position of a planet is 15 meters, 10 million years later this uncertainty would be 150 meters; after 100 million years, a further 9 digits are lost, giving an uncertainty of 150 million kilometers, equivalent to the distance between Earth and the sun. ""Basically you have no idea where the planet is,"" said Laskar.

While 100 million years may seem long, the solar system itself is over 4.5 billion years old, and the lack of dramatic events — such as a planetary collision or a planet being ejected from all this chaotic motion — long puzzled scientists. 

Laskar then looked at the problem in a different way: by simulating the inner planet trajectories over the next 5 billion years, stepping from one moment to the next. He found just a 1% chance of a planetary collision. With the same approach, he calculated that it would take, on average, about 30 billion years for any of the planets to collide. 

Reining in the chaos

Delving through the math, Laskar and his colleagues then identified for the first time ""symmetries"" or ""conserved quantities"" in the gravitational interactions that create a ""practical barrier in the chaotic wandering of the planets,"" Laskar said. 

These emergent quantities remain nearly constant and inhibit certain chaotic motions, but don't prevent them altogether, much like the raised lip of a dinner plate will inhibit food falling off the plate but not prevent it completely. We can thank these quantities for our solar system's apparent stability.

Renu Malhotra
(opens in new tab)
, Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study, highlighted how subtle the mechanisms identified in the study are. Malhotra told Live Science that it is interesting that ""our solar system's planetary orbits exhibit exceptionally weak chaos."" 

In other work, Laskar and colleagues are searching for clues as to whether the number of planets in the solar system ever differed from what we currently see. For all the stability evident today, whether that has always been the case over the billions of years before life evolved remains an open question.

"1 day ago","Scientists discovered a 2,200-year-old condor poop pile in the Andes. Here's what it told them.","Scientists dug into a 2,200-year-old pile of Andean condor poop to study the species’ diet and changes in habitat.","For thousands of years, Andean condors have frequented a cliffside nest, resulting in a ring-shaped guano deposit that continues to increase year after year. A condor chick can be seen in the background. (Image credit: L. Sympson)

For the past 2,200 years, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), among the largest known flying birds in the world, have been nesting — and pooping — at a cliffside grotto in northern Patagonia, Argentina. Now researchers are studying the massive pile of guano to learn more about the threatened species and how it has adapted to its environment over time. 

To study the doughnut-shaped poop mound, which measures roughly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, researchers carved it like a pie, removing a single 10-inch-deep (25 centimeters) slice of excrement. Thanks to the deposit's location inside the grotto, the preserved poo had been well protected from wind and rain, allowing it to amass for thousands of years, according to a study published May 3 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B
(opens in new tab)
.

""By looking at the different layers, we could go back in time,"" lead study author Matthew Duda
(opens in new tab)
, a graduate student of biology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, told Live Science. ""We carbon dated [the pile] to figure out the nest's age, which is over 2,000 years old.""

By examining the preserved poo, the team discovered how the condors' diets had evolved over time.

""Condors are scavengers, and at one time they would fly along the shores and eat carcasses of whales and native species such as llamas and alpacas,"" Duda said. ""But as livestock like sheep and cattle were introduced into South America [by Europeans], their diets changed along with it. We saw a complete shift from before to what is currently most abundant for them to eat.""

Related: Critically endangered condor chicks are species' 1st known 'virgin births'

Unfortunately, this shift also meant the condors are ingesting more lead, which Duda attributed to ""lead shot being used to kill vermin, which the condors would then eat."" These toxic metals were then excreted by the birds.

""We saw that the concentration of lead was significantly higher now than in the past,"" Duda said.

This is particularly concerning since Andean condors are on the Red List of Threatened Species monitored by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
(opens in new tab)
, and their numbers continue to dwindle with only about 6,700 adults still living in the wild.

The researchers also noticed that for one 1,000-year stretch of time, roughly between 650 and 1,650 years ago, the condors more or less abandoned the site, resulting in the guano accumulation dropping drastically from approximately 3 cubic feet (0.08 cubic m) per year to 0.11 cubic feet (0.003 cubic m) per year. They think that increased volcanic activity forced the condors to leave, according to the study.

""We measured an increase in sulfur and sodium, which are both associated with volcanic activity,"" said Duda, who suspects that as volcanic ash blanketed the surrounding vegetation, herbivores were forced to leave in search of new food resources, causing the condors to take flight too.

, a nocturnal fruit-eating bird that uses echolocation to navigate.

""It is clear that quality breeding sites are critical for this species' survival,"" the study authors wrote in their paper. ""To support effective conservation efforts, nesting and roosting sites need extensive protection.""

A new species of deep-sea shark with bright white eyes has finally been identified, decades after a dead pregnant female of the species was first collected off the coast of Western Australia. The ""ghost"" shark was initially misidentified, and was only pegged as a new species after scientists took a second look at its bizarre egg cases that had languished in museum storage for years.

The newfound species, which was described in a new study published April 23 in the Journal of Fish Biology
(opens in new tab)
, has been named Apristurus ovicorrugatus, which is derived from the Latin for egg, ""ovi,"" and ""corrugatus,"" meaning corrugated, in reference to the corrugated egg cases that led to the species' discovery. 

The pregnant female, which was caught in 1992 and held in a museum collection, was carrying a single egg case.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

Along with its unique egg cases, A. ovicorrugatus also possesses unusual, shiny white irises.

""This is not a common feature for a deepwater species and only one other species, Apristurus nakayai from New Caledonia and PNG [Papua New Guinea] shares this character,"" study lead author Will White
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), told Live Science in an email.

Related: Critically endangered hammerhead shark found dead on US beach was pregnant with 40 pups

Apristurus is a genus of catshark. They are commonly known as ghost or demon catsharks
(opens in new tab)
. It is one of the most diverse shark genera in the world, with around 40 known species. 

While the majority of shark species give birth to live young, the rest are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. The egg cases — also known as mermaid's purses — often have long tendrils that allow them to attach to seaweed or rocks.

In 2011, researchers came across an extremely strange egg case
(opens in new tab)
 containing a shark embryo. It was clear the shark belonged to the Apristurus genus, but the egg case did not match any known species. 

For over a decade, the egg case remained a mystery, until scientists found two more sitting in the Australian National Fish Collection, which falls under the CSIRO umbrella. 

""The egg cases possessed very distinctive longitudinal ridges on their surfaces which were T-shaped in cross-section,"" White said. ""Only one other species in the world has been found to have egg cases with that form of ridging and that is a different genus entirely."" 

A late-term embryo was found inside one of the egg cases examined.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

White and his colleagues then trawled through their collection database to see if any other unidentified Apristurus specimens had been found in the small region where the egg cases had been collected. They eventually found the pregnant female: a 1.5 foot-long (46.7 centimeters) shark that had been misidentified as a South China catshark (Apristurus sinensis). 

The female was carrying a single egg case — and it matched the one they'd found a decade ago.

""Luckily the female specimen we found contained an identically ridged egg case and confirmed our suspicions,"" White said. 

Researchers say the discovery of A. ovicorrugatus highlights the importance of egg case shape to identifying species. In Australia, members of the public are invited to upload images of egg cases to a global database
(opens in new tab)
, allowing scientists to better understand where egg-laying sharks are breeding. The A. ovicorrugatus egg cases were found attached to corals, suggesting the species may rely on these organisms for reproduction.

Going forward, White and colleagues are scouring museum collections for more new species to see what else curators have overlooked or misidentified.

(Image credit: Offside / Contributor via Getty Images)

Even light bumps on the head can cause long-term problems, and researchers may now have an idea why: The brain's wiring can change in the aftermath of mild concussions.   

Prior studies suggested that even mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that don't cause any observable structural damage can still trigger symptoms that persist for more than six months. These symptoms range from problems with concentration and fatigue to depression and anxiety. 

Now, Rebecca Woodrow

, a doctoral student at the University of Cambridge's Division of Anaesthesia, and her colleagues report that there can sometimes be an increase in the connectivity of the brain immediately after mild TBI that may help to predict and explain these long-lasting symptoms.

An estimated 50 million new TBI cases
(opens in new tab)
 are reported worldwide each year and this figure has been increasing. The trend prompted scientists to launch CENTER-TBI, a European Union-funded project aimed at improving care for TBI patients.  

Related: Concussions damage the 'bridge' between the two halves of the brain 

The recent study, published in February in the journal Brain
(opens in new tab)
, used CENTER-TBI data and found that, even for mild TBI, in which the patient is expected to make a full recovery within six months, problems often persist beyond that point.

""We were surprised at how many of these patients have a poor outcome,"" Woodrow, the study's first author, told Live Science. ""It was almost half."" 

Although there are treatments available for patients in intensive care for moderate to severe TBI, the understanding of mild TBI and its long-lasting symptoms remains poor, Woodrow said, adding, ""There is limited care for those symptoms, little support for these patients."" 

The brain changes identified in the new study hint at a way of identifying which patients will likely suffer long-lasting symptoms, as well as possible targets for drugs that may aid the recovery.

Woodrow and colleagues analyzed data from 108 TBI patients and 76 controls. This data included not just standard MRI and CT scans, which show brain structure, but also functional MRI (fMRI) scans, which provide data about brain function and are not usually collected for mild TBI. fMRI reveals the regions that have activity levels changing in sync, which are then inferred to be functionally connected. 

The CENTER-TBI dataset is unique because, in addition to brain scans, it includes behavioral data, clinical outcomes and biomarkers, co-senior author Emmanuel Stamatakis
(opens in new tab)
, whose University of Cambridge lab specializes in developing methods to understand fMRI data, told Live Science in an email. ""This makes it feasible to relate brain function to observed behaviour,"" he said.

Although the CT and standard MRI scans didn't reveal structural changes in the TBI patients' brains, the fMRIs showed significantly higher connectivity between the thalamus and the rest of the brain, compared with the healthy controls.

The thalamus is often described as the ""relay"" of the brain because many signals pass through the structure before being shuttled elsewhere. The thalamus is involved in not only primary sensory functions, such as seeing and smelling, but also various complex functions that activate multiple brain regions simultaneously, like concentrating, Woodrow said.

It may be that the brain adapts to injury in other areas of the brain by increasing their connections to the thalamus. Woodrow pointed out that the thalamus' position at the center of the brain also makes it vulnerable to injury from impacts, whatever direction they come from, so the increased connectivity could also be a response to direct thalamus injury.

Increased connectivity across the brain has already been identified in moderate and severe TBI, and in their new study, the authors noted that several past
(opens in new tab)
 studies
(opens in new tab)
 ""support this adaptive hyperconnectivity hypothesis."" 

""We can't claim to fully understand why it happens yet,"" said Stamatakis. Some scientists theorize that, immediately after mild TBI, the brain becomes hyperconnected, but that connectivity later dwindles and becomes lower than usual, in the long-term. 

But Woodrow explained that in mild TBI, it was thought that such hyperconnectivity effects may be much subtler than that seen in severe TBI and not significantly different from the varying connectivity levels normally seen from person to person. Past fMRI studies of mild injuries used small sample sizes of around 20 to 40 people, which limited their ability to identify a trend above baseline noise. 

The current study includes ""the largest sample studied with resting-state functional MRI in mild injury,"" Stamatakis said.

The study showed that not only is it possible to identify connectivity changes in the wake of mild TBI, but that regions where this hyperconnectivity is most prominent correlate with particular symptom types, such as emotional versus cognitive. These connectivity changes also correlate with concentrations of chemical messengers, or ""neurotransmitters"" in these brain regions. The study authors suggest that modulating these neurotransmitters could be a fruitful target for developing drugs to treat mild TBI.

Next, the researchers plan to look at the effects of repetitive concussion, as often seen in sports, to see whether TBI has cumulative effects that could make the consequences of concussion increasingly serious with each knock to the head.

The MacBook Pro 16-inch on offer here comes with the M2 Pro chip, which is not only powerful but flexible, too - it can even run many iPad and iPhone apps, alongside everything a Mac can do (which is a lot, by the way).

Apple Silicon also means a lot of the key internal components are embedded on the same chip, so less power is used transferring data between them. This results in a drastically improved battery life over the prior Intel-based models.

Add to that a return of ports (there's a MagSafe connector that supports fast-charging, three USB-C ports, HDMI output and an SD card slot) and the small matter of the best laptop screen we've tested and you've got a terrific all-rounder.

We've not yet reviewed the M2 Pro model, but in our MacBook Pro 16-inch review, we gave it our highest rating, 5 out of 5 stars, saying that: “the MacBook Pro 16-inch is a powerful and stylish laptop that's ideal for resource-intensive tasks like programming, coding, and video editing.”

Given the jump in power here in the same form factor, it's a great option for coding on the go.

It was long thought that pyrite — a shiny mineral also known as fool's gold — was the special ingredient that gave fossils embedded in Germany's Posidonia Shale their golden glow. But now scientists think something else is causing these fossils to shimmer.

Earlier this year, a team of international researchers visited the Early Jurassic site known for its exceptionally well-preserved fossils of marine animals. They collected dozens of samples of fossilized ammonites, bivalves and crustaceans that were about palm-size or larger. 

Once the team viewed the roughly 183 million-year-old fossils using a high-powered scanning electron microscope, they struggled to find any pyrite in the fossils poking out of the black shale, according to a study published in the March 2023 edition of the journal Earth-Science Reviews

""It was long believed that everything [at the Posidonia Shale] was pyritized,"" study co-author Rowan Martindale
(opens in new tab)
, an associate professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, told Live Science. ""We picked samples that we thought for sure would be all pyrite. And lo and behold there was a little bit of pyrite on a couple of them, but basically it was all phosphatized or yellow calcite. It was pretty much a shock to all of us who worked on the paper.""

After analyzing roughly 70 specimens, it was clear that while the shale surrounding the fossils was ""dotted with microscopic clusters of pyrite crystals, called framboids,"" it was phosphate minerals with yellow calcite that were the source of the fossils' golden glow, according to a statement

""The framboids look like tiny raspberries,"" study co-author Sinjini Sinha
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral candidate in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT, told Live Science. ""After looking at the specimens under a microscope, I only found a few framboids on the fossils themselves but counted 600 to 800 on the surrounding shale.""

Knowing that pyrite and phosphate are present in different parts of the specimens is crucial since it reveals information about the fossilization environment. For example, pyrite forms in anoxic environments where there's no oxygen present, whereas phosphate minerals like yellow calcite need oxygen to form, according to the statement.

The research revealed that even though an anoxic seafloor ""set the stage for fossilization,"" it took a burst of oxygen to cause the chemical reactions necessary for fossilization to occur. The oxygenation combined with the phosphate minerals helped turn the fossils into what looks like gold, according to the statement.

Hidden oceans may lurk under the icy crusts of four of Uranus' moons. 

Scientists recently reanalyzed data from the Voyager spacecraft that flew by Uranus in the 1980s and found that four of Uranus' largest moons — Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon — may be warm enough to host liquid oceans. In Titania and Oberon, these oceans might even be warm enough to potentially support life, according to a recent study in the Journal of Geophysical Research
(opens in new tab)
. 

""When it comes to small bodies — dwarf planets and moons — planetary scientists previously have found evidence of oceans in several unlikely places, including the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and Saturn's moon Mimas,"" study lead author Julie Castillo-Rogez
(opens in new tab)
 of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""So there are mechanisms at play that we don't fully understand.""

The new study integrated 1980s Voyager 2 data with information on other icy moons such as Pluto's Charon and Saturn's Enceladus drawn from more recent NASA missions such as Galileo, Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons. Uranus has 27 moons, but the researchers focused on the five largest, which are Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon and Miranda. Of these, Ariel is the smallest at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, while Titania is the largest at 980 miles (1,580 km) across.

Previously, scientists thought only Tatiana was likely to generate any internal heat via radioactive decay — the process by which unstable atoms lose energy through radiation — believing the other moons to be too small. However, modeling the other moons' porosity suggested that all but Miranda are insulated enough to retain internal heat created by radioactive decay. The researchers also found that any potential oceans beneath the icy crusts of these moons would be rich in chlorides, ammonia and salts, both of which would lower the freezing point of the water. The combination of a low freezing point and enough internal heat could mean that Ariel, Umbrial, Titania and Oberon all have oceans dozens of miles deep within their interiors, the researchers reported.

In 2020, scientists detected some evidence of recent geological activity on Ariel
(opens in new tab)
, suggesting the possible movement of a potential inner ocean. Miranda also has surface features that look relatively fresh, according to the researchers, but their modeling suggests that if the moon did have a liquid ocean at some point, it is likely frozen by now. 

To find out if these hidden oceans really exist, scientists will have to get creative. Spectrometers that can detect wavelengths of light reflected by ammonia and chlorides could help prove the presence of these chemicals under the crusts. Scientists could also use instruments that can detect electrical currents carried by liquid water to probe beneath these moons' surfaces. New modeling studies on how these moons formed could also help researchers plan what kind of observations they will need to make in the future, Castillo-Rogez said.

""We need to develop new models for different assumptions on the origin of the moons in order to guide planning for future observations,"" she said.

A child in Maine who recently tested positive for measles may be the state's first case of the viral infection since 2019, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reported Friday
(opens in new tab)
 (May 5).

While the case still needs to be confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Maine's public health agencies are assuming the child is infectious and working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed.

The CDC recommends
(opens in new tab)
 that children receive their first dose of the MMR vaccine, which guards against measles, mumps and rubella, between 12 months and 15 months old. Children should get their second dose between 4 and 6 years old. Alternatively, the MMRV vaccine, which also guards against varicella (chickenpox), may be given following the same vaccination schedule.

One dose of either vaccine is roughly 93% protective against measles, and two doses are 97% protective, meaning there's a small chance of infection even after two doses. However, vaccinated individuals tend to have much milder cases of the disease than unvaccinated people do.

The Maine child with a positive measles test had received one dose of a measles vaccine. (Neither the child's age nor any of their symptoms, if they had any, were noted in the DHHS statement.)

The Maine DHHS statement includes a list of locations that the measles-positive child recently visited and times they were at each place. ""Anyone at these locations during these times should watch for symptoms for 21 days after their exposure,"" the statement reads. ""If you have symptoms, call a health care provider for instructions before going to the office or hospital to help prevent further spread of infection.""

Between Jan. 1 and April 28, 2023, a total of 10 measles cases were reported nationwide, the CDC reported

While playing outside her school in Norway, an 8-year-old girl found an unexpected treasure — not a lost ball or a discarded jump rope, but a flint dagger crafted by Stone Age people 3,700 years ago.

The student, identified only as Elise in a statement
(opens in new tab)
 translated from Norwegian, discovered the gray-brown dagger when she was playing in a rocky area by her school in Vestland County. ""I was going to pick up a piece of glass, and then the stone was there,"" she said in the statement. 

Elise showed the stone to her teacher, Karen Drange, who saw that the stone looked ancient. Drange contacted Vestland county council, and archaeologists from the county examined the artifact.

The nearly 5-inch-long (12 centimeters) tool is a rare find, Louise Bjerre Petersen
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist with Vestland county municipality, said in the translated statement. Flint, a hard sedimentary rock, does not naturally occur in Norway, so the dagger may have come from across the North Sea in Denmark, according to the statement.

The nearly 5-inch-long (12 centimeters) flint dagger was likely crafted during the Neolithic period about 3,700 years ago.  (Image credit: Vestland County Municipality)

This type of dagger is often found with sacrificial finds, the archaeologists added. To further investigate the area, the Vestland County Council and Vestland County's University Museum in Bergen, Norway's second-largest city, teamed up to explore the school's grounds. But they didn't find any other evidence dating back to the Stone Age, they said in the statement.

Based on its style, the dagger likely dates to the New Stone Age, or the Neolithic, a time when prehistoric humans shaped stone tools
(opens in new tab)
 and began to rely on domesticated plants and animals, build permanent villages and develop crafts, such as pottery. In Norway, the Stone Age, which includes the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, lasted from 10000 B.C. to 1800 B.C., with a number of hunter-gatherers permanently settling down to farm around 2400 B.C., according to Talk Norway
(opens in new tab)
, an educational website on Norway's history and cultural heritage.

The dagger will be cataloged and used in research at the University Museum. The artifact isn't the only Stone Age discovery to recently get attention in Norway. This past winter, the full-body reconstruction of a Stone Age teenager who lived 8,300 years ago went on display at the Hå Gamle Prestegard museum in southern Norway. The teen boy was likely part of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer group, but the details surrounding his death are a mystery; it appears he died alone leaning against a cave wall, as his remains had no indications of a burial.

Astronomers may have just found the remnants of some of the universe's very first stars. The chemical signatures of these faraway, 13-plus-billion-year-old objects are remarkably different from those of younger stars, like our sun. By studying them, scientists hope to shed light on how stars, galaxies and even basic elements form. 

The research, co-authored by University of Florence astrophysicist Stefania Salvadori
(opens in new tab)
, was published May 3 in The Astrophysical Journal
(opens in new tab)
. 

In the earliest days of the universe, only very simple elements such as hydrogen and helium were available. The first stars ignited from these elements alone. Over time, their white-hot cores gradually cooked simple atoms into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, magnesium and eventually metals. Later generations of stars formed from clouds of gas containing these heavier atoms, and today most of the stars scientists observe are rich in metals like iron. (Our sun is about 98% hydrogen and helium, but contains trace amounts of heavier elements like iron, neon and carbon.)

Nobody has observed the original metal-deficient stars directly; most of them probably fizzled out or exploded long ago. But scientists can still observe some of their dusty remains by setting their sights billions of light years away.

RELATED STORIES

—For the first time, scientists watched a dying star swallow a planet whole

—2 stars covered in unusual elements have a puzzling origin story

—The early universe was crammed with stars 10,000 times the size of our sun, new study suggests

Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), Salvadori and her team peered into three distant clouds of star-forming gas. On their own, these clouds wouldn't tell scientists very much, but incoming light from nearby quasars — extremely bright galactic cores formed by dust falling into a supermassive black hole — helped reveal the cloud's secrets. Based on which wavelengths of light the gas clouds absorbed, the team determined what elements the stellar remains were made of. 

Sure enough, the clouds were extremely poor in iron and other metallic elements, but rich in carbon, oxygen and magnesium — precisely what would have been left over after the first stars ran out of fuel and exploded, according to the researchers. This tracks with other research into the origins of stars, and may help explain the composition of younger stars, including those found in the Milky Way. 

""Our discovery opens new avenues to indirectly study the nature of the first stars, fully complementing studies of stars in our galaxy,"" Salvadori said in a statement

It's well known that the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin plays a key role in sleep. But other hormones, including the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone, can also affect our sleep — and potentially even our dreams. 

In particular, people may notice differences in the quality of their sleep and the way they dream at different stages of their menstrual cycle, experts told Live Science. Here's how the menstrual cycle might affect sleep and dreaming.

How the menstrual cycle affects sleep and dreams 

Sleep is broken down into stages, broadly known as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People dream during REM sleep, which usually begins about 90 minutes after a person falls asleep, said Dr. Tania Adib
(opens in new tab)
, a consultant gynecologist at The Lister Hospital in the U.K. 

NREM sleep is broken up into four stages: easily disturbed light sleep, a deeper intermediate sleep, and two stages of deep sleep, which occurs just before REM sleep, according to the Mayo Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. Deep sleep is the most restorative and where the body and brain have time to repair.

Estrogen and progesterone can affect how much time people spend in REM and NREM sleep and whether they wake up often while dreaming.

""There are lots of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the parts of the brain that regulate sleep, and because the levels of these hormones change during the menstrual cycle, it means our sleep also varies across the month,"" said Dr. Zoe Schaedel
(opens in new tab)
, co-founder of Myla Health, a private clinic for women experiencing menopause, perimenopause and reproductive health issues in England. 

The menstrual cycle has four stages: menses (when the period occurs), the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, according to the Cleveland Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. The menstrual cycle ""begins"" on the first day of a period. Prior to ovulation, which occurs roughly around day 14, estrogen levels rise, Schaedel told Live Science. ""Sleep tends to be better-quality in this phase, known as the follicular or proliferative phase.""  

After ovulation, progesterone levels then begin to rise and eventually overtake estrogen; if a pregnancy doesn't occur, the levels of both hormones drop in the lead-up to menstration. ""This is known as the 'luteal phase' and is where we see changes in the structure of sleep,"" Schaedel said.

Shifting progesterone levels during the luteal phase may partly cause disturbed sleep in the lead-up to a person's period, Schaedel said. 

Compared to estrogen, progesterone is thought to be more strongly tied to premenstrual symptoms (PMS), which occur during the luteal phase and commonly include insomnia or oversleeping, according to Mount Sinai.
(opens in new tab)
 These sleep changes aren't fully understood, but rising progesterone in the luteal phase is linked to increased body temperatures and sweating
(opens in new tab)
, which may interfere with sleep because normally, body temperatures decline before and during sleep. The overall ratio of REM to NREM sleep may also decrease during this phase, according to a 2021 review in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience
(opens in new tab)
. 

RELATED STORIES

—Do dreams really reveal our deepest secrets?

—Does the moon affect menstrual cycles?

—Why can't we remember our dreams?

Progesterone and estrogen help modulate chemical messengers in the brain — namely, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) — which regulate mood and stress levels, according to Mount Sinai. Anxiousness and depressed mood due to PMS may undermine people's attempts to fall asleep
(opens in new tab)
, and physical symptoms, like body aches and nausea, may also help explain why people experiencing PMS are prone to sleep disruptions, per the Frontiers in Neuroscience review. 

Melatonin production and sensitivity may also change during the luteal phase, some studies hint, but the research is ""not sufficient""
(opens in new tab)
 to draw strong conclusions.

Sleep disturbances in the luteal phase may increase the likelihood that individuals remember their vivid dreams, Schaedel said. 

""If sleep fragments REM, or you wake up shortly after the REM stage, you are far more likely to remember your dreams,"" Adib told Live Science.

One 2019 study hinted that hormones may also affect the types of dreams a person has
(opens in new tab)
. The study asked hundreds of women to recall the previous night's dreams. Of the women who could remember, those in the luteal phase more often reported their dreams as being ""pleasant,"" while those in other parts of the menstrual cycle were more likely to report their dreams being ""unpleasant."" 

However, it's unclear whether this result would carry over to other, larger groups of people.

(Image credit: Sylvain CORDIER / Contributor via Getty Images)

A school of piranhas attacked holiday makers playing in a stream in a Brazilian resort on May 1, leaving at least eight people injured.

The fish tore at the bathers' legs and feet with their razor-sharp teeth, driving them out of the water and onto a tourist beach in Tarumã-Açu, a region northeast of Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazonas.

Experts think the biting frenzy was a case of ""mistaken identity"" and that the piranhas were actually after the food that visitors at local restaurants sometimes throw into the river.

""Piranhas do not exhibit unprovoked attacks on humans,"" Steve Huskey
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of biology at Western Kentucky University, told Live Science in an email. ""The situation described is one of piranhas becoming acclimated to free food and those bites were just another example of mistaken identity, just like shark attacks.""

Some piranha species, including the red-bellied piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), engage in collective feeding frenzies. ""Species of the genus Pygocentrus, that occur in the Amazon and São Francisco river drainages, are most dangerous,"" Paulo Andreas Buckup
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist and professor at the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, told Live Science in an email.

But this behavior only occurs in exceptional circumstances, such as when a high number of fish are trapped in small pools or starved for a long time, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium
(opens in new tab)
. ""These fish swim in schools and normally do not attack large animals,"" Buckup said.

Related: Swarms of 'mini-shark' beach bugs are on a foot-biting rampage in California 

Most piranhas are harmless and the meat-eating species tend to scavenge rather than hunt living animals. ""Some species of the piranha family eat only fruit, insects and vegetable matter. Some specialize in eating fish scales and nibbling the fins of other fish,"" Buckup said. ""They may attack other live fish or animals, but they will eat dead flesh whenever it is available.""

The presence of bathers in a feeding spot, however, can lead to confusion and aggression. ""Feeding piranhas in a tourist setting strengthens their natural behaviors to school and bite,"" Mark Sabaj Perez
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, Philadelphia, told Live Science in an email.

The attack in Tarumã-Açu could have been triggered by a single piranha mistaking a foot for food, taking a mouthful and drawing blood, which in turn sparked a feeding frenzy. ""An attack is likely to have been caused by presence of blood in the water, skin injuries or movement that appears as a fish in distress,"" Buckup said. ""Because their teeth are so sharp, a single bite [could] cause a lot of bleeding and trigger group feeding frenzy behavior.""

Once the meal begins, piranhas dart in and out to bite their prey at great speed to avoid being accidentally nipped by another individual, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium.

Piranhas have the strongest bite recorded in bony fish — as powerful as a great white shark, according to a 2012 study published in the journal Scientific Reports
(opens in new tab)
. The black piranha (Serrasalmus rhombeus) generates a bite force equivalent to 35 times its body weight, compared to just one time its body weight for a great white, according to Huskey.

""When a piranha focuses that bite force onto their 14 razor-sharp teeth, the bite pressure climbs to immeasurable levels,"" Huskey said. ""They could do tremendous damage to humans throughout South America, if they were so inclined, but they're not… and they don't.""

A rock likely to be a meteorite crashed into a New Jersey home on Monday (May 8), damaging a bedroom but causing no injuries. 

No one was at Suzy Kop's home in Hopewell Township, New Jersey, when the space rock made its entrance, according to CBS News Philadelphia
(opens in new tab)
, which first reported the unusual event. The meteorite landed around 1 p.m. EDT, crashing through the roof and landing in the bedroom belonging to Kop's father. Judging by the damage, the meteorite hit the floor, bounced to the ceiling, and came to rest in the corner of a room. The metallic rock measures about 4 inches by 6 inches (10 by 15 centimeters). 

""I did touch the thing because I thought it was a random rock… and it was warm,"" Kop told CBS News.

Authorities are still investigating the origin of the apparent space rock, but Derrick Pitts
(opens in new tab)
, the chief astronomer at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, told CBS News that it could be four to five billion years old. It’s possible that the meteorite was part of the ongoing Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which roughly occurs between April 19 and May 29 each year, and which reached its peak around May 5 and 6. During peak days, the shower can produce hundreds of ""shooting stars"" per hour – most of which are meteors that burn up in the atmosphere. These meteors are the rocky debris left by Halley’s Comet, which becomes visible from Earth every 75 to 79 years, according to NASA

""For it to actually strike a house, for people to be able to pick up, that's really unusual and has happened very few times in history,"" Pitts said.

In February 2013, a meteor estimated at 59 feet (18 m) in diameter zinged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia. The resulting fireball blew out windows and damaged buildings, causing more than 1,600 reported injuries due to flying glass and debris, according to NASA

(Image credit: EmirMemedovski via Getty Images)

Sleep apnea may be linked to certain indicators of worse brain health, according to a new study.

The study, published Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Neurology
(opens in new tab)
, looked at people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition where the upper throat muscles relax during sleep and block the airway. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sleep studies to examine if sleep apnea and altered sleep were associated with two kinds of unusual patterns in the brain's white matter — the insulated wires that extend from brain cells.

Both severe sleep apnea and reduced time spent in the deep stages of sleep were associated with these two biomarkers, which have each previously been linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or general cognitive decline, as well as having a stroke.

The researchers found ""a pretty significant association between slow-wave sleep duration, or deep sleep time, and these white matter measures,"" said Bryce Mander
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.

Related: Human brain looks years 'older' after just one night without sleep, small study shows 

The study included 140 people with OSA whose average age was about 73 years old. All the participants were screened for one of the two biomarkers, but only 103 were screened for the second, as well. The overall group was relatively evenly split between people with mild, moderate and severe OSA, and most people had no cognitive impairment during the study.

One of the biomarkers that the researchers looked for in brain scans were white matter hyperintensities, ""bright spots commonly seen in the white matter of the brain on MRI, which appear with aging and vascular disease,"" Dr. Diego Carvalho
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine and the senior author of the study, wrote in an email to Live Science. ""They represent areas of damage to the white matter.""

The second biomarker, called ""fractional anisotropy of the genu of the corpus callosum,"" is related to how water flows through brain cells' wires, or axons. Changes in this water flow, wrote Carvalho, are related to axon damage and can be an early sign of vascular disease. The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain and contains the organ's densest white matter. 

Using polysomnography, meaning the variety of data collected during a sleep study, the researchers found that participants who spent less time in slow-wave sleep appeared more affected by both types of biomarkers in their MRIs. Separately, people with severe OSA also appeared more impacted by white matter abnormalities than people with mild or moderate OSA. 

The research reveals associations between sleep apnea, deep sleep, and white matter abnormalities, but it can't say whether these sleep differences caused the abnormalities, or if differences in white matter could be interfering with sleep. It also could be that sleep and white matter abnormalities impact one another, said Mander, contributing to a vicious cycle of poor sleep quality and worse brain health.

""To me, I think that's the most likely outcome,"" he said.

One limitation of the study is that polysomnography data was only collected for the first few hours participants slept; people's sleep patterns might have differed later in the night. After their sleep study, anyone who met criteria for sleep apnea was given treatment in the form of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which can help keep the airway open. Carvalho said that data from this ""treatment phase"" wasn't included because differences in how people responded to the CPAP would have muddied the data.

MRIs and polysomnography were taken, on average, about 1.7 years apart, but researchers only collected each type of data at one point in time, offering only snapshots of patients' brains and sleep patterns and not how they might change over time. The study also did not follow participants to see who might go on to develop dementia.  

Mander said that future research should examine how sleep apnea's impact on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage of sleep when most dreaming happens, might affect the brain. (Slow-wave sleep occurs in certain stages of non-REM sleep.) However, the new study introduces important ideas about ""how sleep apnea and sleep disturbance might be associated with cognitive decline,"" he said.

"about 22 hours ago","1st draft of a human 'pangenome' published, adding millions of 'building blocks' to the human reference genome","A new version of the human reference genome incorporates genetic data from 47 individuals from around the globe, deepening scientists' view into how genes work.","A new human reference ""pangenome"" includes DNA data from 47 people. (Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)

Scientists have published the first human ""pangenome"" — a full genetic sequence that incorporates genomes from not just one individual, but 47. 

These 47 individuals hail from around the globe and thus vastly increase the diversity of the genomes represented in the sequence, compared to the previous full human genome sequence that scientists use as their reference for study. The first human genome sequence was released with some gaps in 2003 and only made ""gapless"" in 2022. If that first human genome is a simple linear string of genetic code, the new pangenome is a series of branching paths.

The ultimate goal of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, which published the first draft of the pangenome on Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Nature
(opens in new tab)
, is to sequence at least 350 individuals from different populations around the world. Although 99.9% of the genome is the same from person to person, there is a lot of diversity found in that final 0.1%.

""Rather than using a single genome sequence as our coordinate system, we should instead have a representation that is based on the genomes of many different people so we can better capture genetic diversity in humans,"" Melissa Gymrek
(opens in new tab)
, a genetics researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the project, told Live Science. 

Related: More than 150 'made-from-scratch' genes are in the human genome. 2 are totally unique to us. 

The newly drafted human pangenome is a collection of different genomes from which to compare an individual genome sequence. Like a map of the subway system, the pangenome graph has many possible routes for a sequence to take, represented by the different colors.   The detouring paths at the top of the image represent single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which are single letter differences. The yellow path that loops around itself and repeats the same nucleotides represents a duplication variant. The pink path that loops counterclockwise and follows the nucleotide sequence backwards represents an inversion variant. At the bottom, the green and dark blue paths miss the C nucleotide in its route and represent a deletion variant. The light blue path, which has extra nucleotides in its route, represents an insertion variant. (Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)
A reference for health 

The first full human genome sequence was completed in 2003 by the Human Genome Project and was based on one person's DNA. Later, bits and pieces from about 20 other individuals were added, but 70% of the sequence scientists use to benchmark genetic variation still comes from a single person. 

Geneticists use the reference genome as a guide when sequencing pieces of people's genetic codes, Arya Massarat
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student in Gymrek's lab who co-authored an editorial about the new research with her in the journal Nature, told Live Science. They match the newly decoded DNA snippets to the reference to figure out how they fit within the genome as a whole. They also use the reference genome as a standard to pinpoint genetic variations — different versions of genes that diverge from the reference — that might be linked with health conditions. 

But with a single reference mostly from one person, scientists have only a limited window of genetic diversity to study.

The first pangenome draft now doubles the number of large genome variants, known as structural variants, that scientists can detect, bringing them up to 18,000. These are places in the genome where large chunks have been deleted, inserted or rearranged. The new draft also adds 119 million new base pairs, meaning the paired ""letters"" that make up the DNA sequence, and 1,115 new gene duplication mutations to the previous version of the human genome.

""It really is understanding and cataloging these differences between genomes that allow us to understand how cells operate and their biology and how they function, as well as understanding genetic differences and how they contribute to understanding human disease,"" study co-author Karen Miga
(opens in new tab)
, a geneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said at a press conference held May 9. 

The pangenome could help scientists get a better grasp of complex conditions in which genes play an influential role, such as autism, schizophrenia, immune disorders and coronary heart disease, researchers involved with the study said at the press conference. 

For example, the Lipoprotein A gene is known to be one of the biggest risk factors for coronary heart disease in African Americans, but the specific genetic changes involved are complex and poorly understood, study co-author Evan Eichler
(opens in new tab)
, a genomics researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, told reporters. With the pangenome, researchers can now more thoroughly compare the variation in people with heart disease and without, and this could help clarify individuals' risk of heart disease based on what variants of the gene they carry. 

Related: As little as 1.5% of our genome is 'uniquely human'  

A diverse understanding 

The current pangenome draft used data from participants in the 1000 Genomes Project, which was the first attempt to sequence genomes from a large number of people from around the world. The included participants had agreed for their genetic sequences to be anonymized and included in publicly available databases. 

The new study also used advanced sequencing technology called ""long-read sequencing,"" as opposed to the short-read sequencing that came before. Short-read sequencing is what happens when you send your DNA to a company like 23andMe, Eichler said. Researchers read out small segments of DNA and then stitch them together into a whole. This kind of sequencing can capture a decent amount of genetic variation, but there can be poor overlap between each DNA fragment. Long-read sequencing, on the other hand, captures big segments of DNA all at once.

While it's possible to sequence a genome with short-read sequencing for about $500, long-read sequencing is still expensive, costing about $10,000 a genome, Eichler said. The price is coming down, however, and the pangenome team hopes to sequence their next batches of genomes at half that cost or less. 

The researchers are working to recruit new participants to continue to fill in diversity gaps in the pangenome, study co-author Eimear Kenny
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of medicine and genetics at  the Institute for Genomic Health at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told reporters. Because genetic information is sensitive and because different rules govern data-sharing and privacy in different countries, this is delicate work. Issues include privacy, informed consent, and the possibility of discrimination based on genetic information, Kenny said. 

Already, researchers are uncovering new genetic processes with the draft pangenome. In two papers published in Nature alongside the work, researchers looked at highly repetitive segments of the genome. These segments have traditionally been difficult to study, biochemist Brian McStay
(opens in new tab)
 of the National University of Ireland Galway, told Live Science, because sequencing them via short-read technology makes it hard to understand how they fit together. The long read technology allows for long chunks of these repetitive sequences to be read at once. 

The studies found that in one type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
, known as segmental duplications, there is a larger than expected amount of variation, potentially a mechanism for the long-term evolution of new functions for genes. In another type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
 that is responsible for building the cellular machines that create new proteins, though, the genome stays remarkably stable. The pangenome allowed researchers to discover a potential mechanism for how these key segments of DNA stay consistent over time.

""This is just the start,"" McStay said. ""There will be a whole lot of new biology that will come out of this.""

Humpback whales have — for the first time ever — been filmed rolling to and fro on sandy seabeds to scrub off dead skin and unwanted hitchhikers.

Footage captured by researchers in the Gold Coast Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia, shows the gigantic marine mammals performing full and side ""sand rolls"" up to 164 feet (50 meters) below the ocean's surface to shed parasites that live on their skin, known as ectoparasites, which can make the whales less hydrodynamic.

""We believe that the whales exfoliate using the sand to assist with molting and removal of ectoparasites, such as barnacles, and specifically select areas suitable for this behavior,"" Olaf Meynecke
(opens in new tab)
, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia who led the research, said in a statement

Although humpback whales have been spotted hovering and feeding near the seafloor before, this is the first time researchers have recorded them rolling in the sand. A 2016 study published in the journal Marine Biodiversity Records
(opens in new tab)
 suggested that humpbacks used the seabed for hygienic purposes, but the reported sightings were opportunistic and made from a boat rather than underwater.

Barnacles are sturdy little crustaceans related to lobsters and shrimp. They cement themselves to other sea creatures with one of the most powerful known natural glues, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ocean Service
(opens in new tab)
. Whales need to remove these crusty parasites to stay streamlined and preserve energy, according to a study describing the sand rolling behavior, published March 12 in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering
(opens in new tab)
.

The whales picked a shallow, sandy location near their migration route to exfoliate, moving head first through the substrate while they rolled. The density of parasites is generally higher around the face than elsewhere, so getting rid of them requires a rigorous rub, according to the study.

The researchers tagged three humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) between August 2021 and October 2022 using suction-cup sensors that recorded high-definition video, as well as light, pressure, temperature and GPS data. The animals were on their summer migration path from tropical breeding grounds near the Great Barrier Reef, to cooler feeding grounds in Antarctica.

While they cannot exclude the possibility that the whales were trying to scratch off the tags, the researchers note that other individuals that were not tagged were also seen rolling across the seabed in the new footage. The tagged humpbacks also did not seem to be targeting the skin carrying the sensors.

The whale exfoliation also provided a tasty snack for small fish called silver trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus), which were seen feeding on dead skin flakes just after the sand rolls.

As well as staying streamlined, exfoliating on the seabed could help humpbacks maintain healthy skin. 

""Humpback whales host diverse communities of skin bacteria that can pose a threat for open wounds if bacteria grow in large numbers,"" Meynecke said. ""Removing excess skin is likely a necessity to maintain a healthy bacterial skin community."" Humpbacks remove some barnacles and skin via breaches — where a whale leaps from the water — but not all, he said.

Rolling around could also be a social activity related to play or relaxation. ""During the different deployments, the sand rolling was observed in the context of socializing,"" Meynecke said. ""The behavior was either following courtship, competition or other forms of socializing."" Other whale species, including bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) are known to rub against rocks, pebbles and mud on the seafloor to shed excess skin.

If you're looking for a quality fitness tracker for yourself or a family member, and want to save some money, we've found a great Fitbit Charge 5 deal for you. Amazon have knocked a fantastic 32% off the retail price
(opens in new tab)
, bringing this best Fitbit down to $102: there has never been a better time to join the Fitbit club!

We've tested this model extensively, and you can read our Fitbit Charge 5 review to get a better understanding of what it's all about. If you just want to know if it's any good... well, it is listed in our guide to the best fitness trackers — and for good reason. The Fitbit model comes with full GPS, an ECG feature, and it's one of the few Fitbits that has a clever EDA sensor, which can measure stress. The only other models that offer this are the more high-end trackers in Fitbit's range, like the Versa and the Sense, which right now cost around $100 more.

If you're not convinced whether you want a Charge 5 or a different Fitbit altogether, we've done some handy comparisons to help you decide: Fitbit Charge 4 vs Charge 5 and Fitbit Inspire 3 vs Fitbit Charge 5.

Fitbit Charge 5 | Was $149.95, Now $102.00 on Amazon
Save a brilliant 32% on one of the top fitness trackers on the market. Coming with a 7-day battery life, built-in GPS, advanced health features like an ECG and EDA function along with the ability to track your sleep, this stellar fitness band is suitable for most people. 

VIEW DEAL

Our favorite features of this model are the sleep tracking options, the heart rate monitor, built-in GPS, and the handy stress management sensor. 

Plus, if you do take the plunge but decide that the Fitbit Charge 5 isn't right for you (or your loved one), you can always return the wearable, as long as it hasn't been used. 

Here at Live Science, we've tried and tested many great fitness trackers and some of the best running watches for both the US and UK markets, from the likes of Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit. 

So we speak from experience when we say that the Charge 5 is one of the best models for anyone looking to pick up their first fitness tracker. It has all the features you need to really hone both your fitness and wellness routine, without breaking the bank. The band comes in three different colors: graphite black, lunar white and steel blue, so it'll suit most workout outfits.

We appreciate some of the enhanced personal safety features too, like the GPS, which allows for phone-free route tracking; and the ECG sensor which analyses your heart rhythm to check for abnormalities. But if we're honest, it's the impressive EDA stress sensor that Fitbit introduced into the watch that makes it stand out from the crowd. Who wouldn't want to track and stay on top of their stress levels?

It does also come with blood oxygenation readings and fitness plans. If you pay the $102 price tag today, the watch includes a 6-month Fitbit Premium trial, although you'll need to pay an extra $9.99 a month thereafter to access these features.

Shark attacks are extremely rare
(opens in new tab)
 — you're unlikely to meet one in the flesh, let alone be bitten. But during World War II, the sinking of a U.S. Navy ship led to one of the most infamous shark attacks in history and the deaths of hundreds of men, with the explosion drawing in the apex predators and sparking a feeding frenzy that lasted for days.

In July 1945, the USS Indianapolis had completed a trip to a naval base on the Pacific island of Tinian to deliver uranium and other components that would be used to create the atomic bomb ""Little Boy."" The first nuclear weapon ever used in wartime, it would later be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

After delivering the parts, the Indianapolis departed for the Philippines on training duty. Shortly after midnight on July 30, the ship was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, causing massive damage. It began to take on huge amounts of water, and sank in just 12 minutes. Of the 1,195 men
(opens in new tab)
 on board, around 300 went down with the ship, but nearly 900 were left adrift in the open ocean.

Many died of exposure, dehydration and saltwater poisoning. However, according to Smithsonian Magazine, up to 150 sailors and crew are estimated to have been killed by sharks — in what is considered the worst shark attack in history. But why?

Dangerous sharks and how they hunt

Unlike some other predators, such as lions and wolves, most sharks hunt alone, Nico Booyens, a marine biologist and director of research at the Shark Research Unit
(opens in new tab)
 in South Africa, told Live Science in an email. ""Different shark species have different hunting techniques, but many sharks are solitary predators that rely on their senses of sight, smell and electroreception to locate their prey.""

Sharks also have a special system called a lateral line
(opens in new tab)
 that picks up the vibrations in the water, Booyens says. This sensory ability would have allowed them to detect the movement of the men in the water as they thrashed around to stay afloat. Once the sharks had located the sailors, they stood little chance of survival — especially those who were injured.

Related: In rare attack, great white shark decapitates diver in Mexico. But why?

According to survivor accounts, many victims were attacked near the surface of the water. This has since led to suggestions that oceanic whitetip sharks
(opens in new tab)
 (Carcharhinus longimanus) were the involved in the attacks because they are a surface-dwelling species
(opens in new tab)
.

""When a shark has located its prey, it will often use its sharp teeth and powerful jaws to bite and tear chunks of flesh from the prey,"" Booyens added. ""Some sharks, like the tiger shark [Galeocerdo cuvier], are known for their ability to swallow their prey whole, while others, like the bull shark [Carcharhinus leucas], will attack and bite their prey repeatedly until it is weakened or immobilized.""

Although oceanic whitetips are at the top of the food chain, their meals can be few and far between, so they are often opportunistic feeders. According to the Florida Museum
(opens in new tab)
, the species is often the first to appear at the site of oceanic disasters, and was also a major cause of fatalities after the sinking of the RMS Nova Scotia in 1942. The species is known to be persistent, unpredictable and shows little fear, making it particularly dangerous to humans, the Florida Museum said.

The worst shark attack in history 

Oceanic whitetip sharks was a major cause of concern for downed planes and sunken ships during World War II and is often the first species at the scene of ocean disasters.  (Image credit: atese/Getty Images)

At the USS Indianapolis, the bodies of the dead and the injured were picked off first. Survivor Corporal Edgar Harrell told the Indianapolis Star
(opens in new tab)
 in 2014: ""That first morning, we had sharks."" As men got separated they would be targeted,"" he explained. ""You hear a blood-curdling scream. And then the body would go under, and then that life vest popped back up.""

The men were too scared to eat or move, for fear of being preyed upon. According to the report of a survivor, one of the sailors opened a can of Spam, the primary ration at the time, but was surrounded by sharks, resulting in a ""feeding frenzy.""

""Feeding frenzies typically occur when there is a sudden abundance of food, such as when a large school of fish is trapped in a small area,"" Booyens said. ""The scent of blood and the thrashing of prey can trigger a feeding frenzy, causing sharks to swarm and compete for the available food.""

The survivors of the USS Indianapolis were at sea for four days before rescue teams arrived.  (Image credit: PhotoQuest/Getty Images)

Many species of shark may engage in frenzied hunting, during which they can become very aggressive and attack each other as well as the prey. However, oceanic whitetips’ opportunistic feeding behavior — as well as their size and strength — made them particularly dangerous for the sailors. ""Feeding frenzies can be dangerous for humans who happen to be in the water, as the sharks may not be able to distinguish between prey and people,"" Booyens added.

For four days, no rescue arrived. Although the U.S. Navy had received word that a Japanese submarine had sunk a U.S. vessel, the message was believed to be fake — in an attempt to lure American rescue boats into a trap. Meanwhile, the survivors tried to stay alive by floating in groups, but in the scorching heat, many succumbed to dehydration. Others died from hypernatremia — too much sodium in the blood — from being forced to drink the salty seawater.

Eventually, a Navy plane flying overhead spotted the Indianapolis survivors and radioed for help. Food, water and rafts were dropped for the surviving men, before a seaplane was landed by Lt. Adrian Marks to rescue some of the survivors from the sharks. Finally, the USS Cecil J. Doyle helped to pull the remaining survivors from the water. Only 316 men survived.

"1 day ago","Some of the 1st ice age humans who ventured into Americas came from China, DNA study suggests","The first wave of humans into the Americas during the last ice age may have hailed partly from northern China, according to a DNA study of ancient and modern Indigenous people.","Some of the first ice age people who ventured into the Americas hailed from northern China. (Image credit: SrdjanPav via Getty Images)

Ice age groups in the ancient northern coast of China helped make up the first wave of people to settle the New World, a new DNA study suggests.

The ancient groups may have also migrated to Japan, potentially helping explain similarities in Stone Age artifacts in the Americas, China and Japan, according to the study, published Tuesday (May 9) in the journal Cell Reports
(opens in new tab)
.

There are two leading models as to how people first migrated to the Americas. The older idea suggests that ancient Siberians made this journey when the Bering Land Bridge — the landmass that once connected Asia with North America — was relatively free of ice. More recent evidence argues that multiple waves of humans journeyed to the Americas from various parts of Eurasia, perhaps on watercraft along the Pacific coasts of Asia, the Bering Land Bridge and North America.

To shed light on the origins of Indigenous Americans, scientists examined DNA from mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria possess their own genes, which are passed down from the mother.

The researchers analyzed more than 100,000 contemporary and 15,000 ancient DNA samples from across Eurasia. They focused on a rare mitochondrial DNA lineage called D4h, which is currently found in only about 1 in 200 people worldwide.

Related: Modern humans migrated into Europe in 3 waves, 'ambitious and provocative' new study suggests

""This genetic type had only been sporadically reported in different studies,"" study lead author Yu-Chun Li
(opens in new tab)
, a molecular anthropologist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China, told Live Science in an email. ""Therefore, this female lineage, as well as its origin and dispersal history — especially its dispersal into the Americas — gained little attention until now."" 

Previous research
(opens in new tab)
 found that one branch of D4h, known as D4h3a, was seen in Indigenous Americans, while another offshoot named D4h3b was detected in China and Thailand. This suggested that ancient members of the D4h lineage might help bridge Asia and the Americas.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (26,500 to 19,000 years ago), ice age humans with the maternal lineage D4h3a left Asia and likely crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

""The most difficult work was to collect as many samples belonging to D4h as we could,"" study senior author Qing-Peng Kong
(opens in new tab)
, an evolutionary geneticist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, told Live Science in an email.

By comparing mutations seen in mitochondrial DNA over time, as well as the geographic locations and radiocarbon dates of the fossils from which ancient DNA was collected, the scientists found D4h3a likely originated in northern coastal China.

""The ancestral sources of Native Americans in Asia are more complicated than previously indicated,"" Li said.

The new findings suggest that the ancestors and closest relatives of D4h3a entered the Americas through at least two migrations. Both diasporas apparently occurred when the land bridge from Asia to the Americas was obstructed by ice, so the researchers suggest that ice age people may have traveled via the Pacific coast instead. 

The first migration likely happened between 19,500 and 26,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest part of the last ice age, the researchers said. Back then, ice sheets covered much of the planet, and living in northern China would have likely proven difficult for humans.

During the last deglaciation (19,000 to 11,500 years ago), people from what is now northern China likely journeyed to Japan. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

The scientists estimated the second event apparently occurred between 19,000 and 11,500 years ago, when the ice sheets began melting. Prior work suggested this climate shift likely helped support the rapid growth seen in human populations during this era, which may have helped drive their spread into other regions.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that during the second wave, one lineage branched out from northern coastal China and traveled to Japan, where they contributed to the Japanese gene pool, especially the indigenous Ainu people. ""This points to an unexpected genetic link between Native Americans and the Japanese,"" Kong said.

In all, the new study ""matches well with what we know about the archaeological record of Japan, and lends weight to current models of how humans came to populate the Americas,"" Loren Davis
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis who did not take part in this research, told Live Science in an email.

—Unknown lineage of ice age Europeans discovered in genetic study

—Prehistoric population once lived in Siberia, but mysteriously vanished, genetic study finds

—Humans crossed the Bering Land Bridge to people the Americas. Here's what it looked like 18,000 years ago.

This discovery may help explain some archeological similarities that prior work controversially suggested at times existed between Stone Age peoples in China, Japan and the Americas. Specifically, researchers had argued the three regions possessed similarities in how they crafted ""stemmed projectile points"" for arrowheads and spears. 

Although the scientists focused on mitochondrial DNA, additional genetic analyses they conducted suggest that male ancestors of Indigenous Americans also lived in northern China at about the same time as these female ancestors.

However, while the new study is exciting, it's just ""another piece of the puzzle,"" on how and when ice age humans first populated the Americas, Davis said. For instance, the researchers stressed that while these new findings suggest this single northern Chinese lineage may have contributed to Indigenous American ancestry, ""it does not represent the whole history of all Native Americans,"" Li said. ""Investigating other lineages showing genetic connections between Asia and the Americas will help obtain the whole picture of the history of Native Americans.""

Earth probably shouldn't exist. 

That's because the orbits of the inner solar system planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are chaotic, and models have suggested that these inner planets should have crashed into each other by now. And yet, that hasn't happened.

New research published May 3 in the journal Physical Review X
(opens in new tab)
 may finally explain why.

Through a deep plunge into the models for planetary motion, the researchers discovered that the motions of the inner planets are constrained by certain parameters that act as a tether that inhibits the system's chaos. Besides providing a mathematical explanation for the apparent harmony in our solar system, the new study's insights may help scientists understand the trajectories of exoplanets surrounding other stars. 

Unpredictable planets

Planets constantly exert a mutual gravitational pull on each other – and these little tugs constantly make minor adjustments to the planets' orbits. The outer planets, which are much larger, are more resistant to little tugs and so maintain comparatively stable orbits. 

The problem of inner planet trajectories, however, is still too complicated to solve exactly. In the late 19th century, mathematician Henri Poincaré proved that it is mathematically impossible to solve the equations governing the motion for three or more interacting objects, often known as the ""three body problem."" As a result, uncertainties in the details of the planets' starting positions and velocities balloon over time. In other words: It is possible to take two scenarios in which the distances between Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth differ by the slightest amount, and in one the planets smash into each other and in another they veer apart.

The time it takes for two trajectories with almost identical starting conditions to diverge by a specific amount is known as the Lyapunov time of the chaotic system. In 1989, Jacques Laskar
(opens in new tab)
, astronomer and research director at the National Center for Scientific Research and Paris Observatory and a co-author of the new study, calculated the characteristic Lyapunov time 
(opens in new tab)
for the planetary orbits of the inner solar system was just 5 million years. 

""It means basically that you lose one digit every 10 million years,"" Laskar, told Live Science. So, for example if the initial uncertainty in the position of a planet is 15 meters, 10 million years later this uncertainty would be 150 meters; after 100 million years, a further 9 digits are lost, giving an uncertainty of 150 million kilometers, equivalent to the distance between Earth and the sun. ""Basically you have no idea where the planet is,"" said Laskar.

While 100 million years may seem long, the solar system itself is over 4.5 billion years old, and the lack of dramatic events — such as a planetary collision or a planet being ejected from all this chaotic motion — long puzzled scientists. 

Laskar then looked at the problem in a different way: by simulating the inner planet trajectories over the next 5 billion years, stepping from one moment to the next. He found just a 1% chance of a planetary collision. With the same approach, he calculated that it would take, on average, about 30 billion years for any of the planets to collide. 

Reining in the chaos

Delving through the math, Laskar and his colleagues then identified for the first time ""symmetries"" or ""conserved quantities"" in the gravitational interactions that create a ""practical barrier in the chaotic wandering of the planets,"" Laskar said. 

These emergent quantities remain nearly constant and inhibit certain chaotic motions, but don't prevent them altogether, much like the raised lip of a dinner plate will inhibit food falling off the plate but not prevent it completely. We can thank these quantities for our solar system's apparent stability.

Renu Malhotra
(opens in new tab)
, Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study, highlighted how subtle the mechanisms identified in the study are. Malhotra told Live Science that it is interesting that ""our solar system's planetary orbits exhibit exceptionally weak chaos."" 

In other work, Laskar and colleagues are searching for clues as to whether the number of planets in the solar system ever differed from what we currently see. For all the stability evident today, whether that has always been the case over the billions of years before life evolved remains an open question.

Here's what it told them.","Scientists dug into a 2,200-year-old pile of Andean condor poop to study the species’ diet and changes in habitat.","For thousands of years, Andean condors have frequented a cliffside nest, resulting in a ring-shaped guano deposit that continues to increase year after year. A condor chick can be seen in the background. (Image credit: L. Sympson)

For the past 2,200 years, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), among the largest known flying birds in the world, have been nesting — and pooping — at a cliffside grotto in northern Patagonia, Argentina. Now researchers are studying the massive pile of guano to learn more about the threatened species and how it has adapted to its environment over time. 

To study the doughnut-shaped poop mound, which measures roughly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, researchers carved it like a pie, removing a single 10-inch-deep (25 centimeters) slice of excrement. Thanks to the deposit's location inside the grotto, the preserved poo had been well protected from wind and rain, allowing it to amass for thousands of years, according to a study published May 3 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B
(opens in new tab)
.

""By looking at the different layers, we could go back in time,"" lead study author Matthew Duda
(opens in new tab)
, a graduate student of biology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, told Live Science. ""We carbon dated [the pile] to figure out the nest's age, which is over 2,000 years old.""

By examining the preserved poo, the team discovered how the condors' diets had evolved over time.

""Condors are scavengers, and at one time they would fly along the shores and eat carcasses of whales and native species such as llamas and alpacas,"" Duda said. ""But as livestock like sheep and cattle were introduced into South America [by Europeans], their diets changed along with it. We saw a complete shift from before to what is currently most abundant for them to eat.""

Related: Critically endangered condor chicks are species' 1st known 'virgin births'

Unfortunately, this shift also meant the condors are ingesting more lead, which Duda attributed to ""lead shot being used to kill vermin, which the condors would then eat."" These toxic metals were then excreted by the birds.

""We saw that the concentration of lead was significantly higher now than in the past,"" Duda said.

This is particularly concerning since Andean condors are on the Red List of Threatened Species monitored by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
(opens in new tab)
, and their numbers continue to dwindle with only about 6,700 adults still living in the wild.

The researchers also noticed that for one 1,000-year stretch of time, roughly between 650 and 1,650 years ago, the condors more or less abandoned the site, resulting in the guano accumulation dropping drastically from approximately 3 cubic feet (0.08 cubic m) per year to 0.11 cubic feet (0.003 cubic m) per year. They think that increased volcanic activity forced the condors to leave, according to the study.

""We measured an increase in sulfur and sodium, which are both associated with volcanic activity,"" said Duda, who suspects that as volcanic ash blanketed the surrounding vegetation, herbivores were forced to leave in search of new food resources, causing the condors to take flight too.

A new species of deep-sea shark with bright white eyes has finally been identified, decades after a dead pregnant female of the species was first collected off the coast of Western Australia. The ""ghost"" shark was initially misidentified, and was only pegged as a new species after scientists took a second look at its bizarre egg cases that had languished in museum storage for years.

The newfound species, which was described in a new study published April 23 in the Journal of Fish Biology
(opens in new tab)
, has been named Apristurus ovicorrugatus, which is derived from the Latin for egg, ""ovi,"" and ""corrugatus,"" meaning corrugated, in reference to the corrugated egg cases that led to the species' discovery. 

The pregnant female, which was caught in 1992 and held in a museum collection, was carrying a single egg case.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

Along with its unique egg cases, A. ovicorrugatus also possesses unusual, shiny white irises.

""This is not a common feature for a deepwater species and only one other species, Apristurus nakayai from New Caledonia and PNG [Papua New Guinea] shares this character,"" study lead author Will White
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), told Live Science in an email.

Apristurus is a genus of catshark. They are commonly known as ghost or demon catsharks
(opens in new tab)
. It is one of the most diverse shark genera in the world, with around 40 known species. 

While the majority of shark species give birth to live young, the rest are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. The egg cases — also known as mermaid's purses — often have long tendrils that allow them to attach to seaweed or rocks.

In 2011, researchers came across an extremely strange egg case
(opens in new tab)
 containing a shark embryo. It was clear the shark belonged to the Apristurus genus, but the egg case did not match any known species. 

For over a decade, the egg case remained a mystery, until scientists found two more sitting in the Australian National Fish Collection, which falls under the CSIRO umbrella. 

""The egg cases possessed very distinctive longitudinal ridges on their surfaces which were T-shaped in cross-section,"" White said. ""Only one other species in the world has been found to have egg cases with that form of ridging and that is a different genus entirely."" 

A late-term embryo was found inside one of the egg cases examined.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

White and his colleagues then trawled through their collection database to see if any other unidentified Apristurus specimens had been found in the small region where the egg cases had been collected. They eventually found the pregnant female: a 1.5 foot-long (46.7 centimeters) shark that had been misidentified as a South China catshark (Apristurus sinensis). 

The female was carrying a single egg case — and it matched the one they'd found a decade ago.

""Luckily the female specimen we found contained an identically ridged egg case and confirmed our suspicions,"" White said. 

Researchers say the discovery of A. ovicorrugatus highlights the importance of egg case shape to identifying species. In Australia, members of the public are invited to upload images of egg cases to a global database
(opens in new tab)
, allowing scientists to better understand where egg-laying sharks are breeding. The A. ovicorrugatus egg cases were found attached to corals, suggesting the species may rely on these organisms for reproduction.

Going forward, White and colleagues are scouring museum collections for more new species to see what else curators have overlooked or misidentified.

"2 days ago","Even mild concussions can 'rewire' the brain, possibly causing long-term symptoms","After a mild concussion, parts of the brain can become ""hyperconnected,"" and this may contribute to patients' long-lasting symptoms.","Gary Neville of the Manchester United Football Club holds his head after a collision with Dion Dublin of Aston Villa during a match held in March 2003. (Image credit: Offside / Contributor via Getty Images)

Even light bumps on the head can cause long-term problems, and researchers may now have an idea why: The brain's wiring can change in the aftermath of mild concussions.   

Prior studies suggested that even mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that don't cause any observable structural damage can still trigger symptoms that persist for more than six months. These symptoms range from problems with concentration and fatigue to depression and anxiety. 

Now, Rebecca Woodrow
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student at the University of Cambridge's Division of Anaesthesia, and her colleagues report that there can sometimes be an increase in the connectivity of the brain immediately after mild TBI that may help to predict and explain these long-lasting symptoms.

An estimated 50 million new TBI cases
(opens in new tab)
 are reported worldwide each year and this figure has been increasing. The trend prompted scientists to launch CENTER-TBI, a European Union-funded project aimed at improving care for TBI patients.  

Related: Concussions damage the 'bridge' between the two halves of the brain 

The recent study, published in February in the journal Brain
(opens in new tab)
, used CENTER-TBI data and found that, even for mild TBI, in which the patient is expected to make a full recovery within six months, problems often persist beyond that point.

""We were surprised at how many of these patients have a poor outcome,"" Woodrow, the study's first author, told Live Science. ""It was almost half."" 

Although there are treatments available for patients in intensive care for moderate to severe TBI, the understanding of mild TBI and its long-lasting symptoms remains poor, Woodrow said, adding, ""There is limited care for those symptoms, little support for these patients."" 

The brain changes identified in the new study hint at a way of identifying which patients will likely suffer long-lasting symptoms, as well as possible targets for drugs that may aid the recovery.

Woodrow and colleagues analyzed data from 108 TBI patients and 76 controls. This data included not just standard MRI and CT scans, which show brain structure, but also functional MRI (fMRI) scans, which provide data about brain function and are not usually collected for mild TBI. fMRI reveals the regions that have activity levels changing in sync, which are then inferred to be functionally connected. 

The CENTER-TBI dataset is unique because, in addition to brain scans, it includes behavioral data, clinical outcomes and biomarkers, co-senior author Emmanuel Stamatakis
(opens in new tab)
, whose University of Cambridge lab specializes in developing methods to understand fMRI data, told Live Science in an email. ""This makes it feasible to relate brain function to observed behaviour,"" he said.

Although the CT and standard MRI scans didn't reveal structural changes in the TBI patients' brains, the fMRIs showed significantly higher connectivity between the thalamus and the rest of the brain, compared with the healthy controls.  

Related: This blood test can detect brain injuries, but some doctors say it might be pointless

The thalamus is often described as the ""relay"" of the brain because many signals pass through the structure before being shuttled elsewhere. The thalamus is involved in not only primary sensory functions, such as seeing and smelling, but also various complex functions that activate multiple brain regions simultaneously, like concentrating, Woodrow said.

It may be that the brain adapts to injury in other areas of the brain by increasing their connections to the thalamus. Woodrow pointed out that the thalamus' position at the center of the brain also makes it vulnerable to injury from impacts, whatever direction they come from, so the increased connectivity could also be a response to direct thalamus injury.

Increased connectivity across the brain has already been identified in moderate and severe TBI, and in their new study, the authors noted that several past
(opens in new tab)
 studies
(opens in new tab)
 ""support this adaptive hyperconnectivity hypothesis."" 

""We can't claim to fully understand why it happens yet,"" said Stamatakis. Some scientists theorize that, immediately after mild TBI, the brain becomes hyperconnected, but that connectivity later dwindles and becomes lower than usual, in the long-term. 

But Woodrow explained that in mild TBI, it was thought that such hyperconnectivity effects may be much subtler than that seen in severe TBI and not significantly different from the varying connectivity levels normally seen from person to person. Past fMRI studies of mild injuries used small sample sizes of around 20 to 40 people, which limited their ability to identify a trend above baseline noise. 

The current study includes ""the largest sample studied with resting-state functional MRI in mild injury,"" Stamatakis said.

The study showed that not only is it possible to identify connectivity changes in the wake of mild TBI, but that regions where this hyperconnectivity is most prominent correlate with particular symptom types, such as emotional versus cognitive. These connectivity changes also correlate with concentrations of chemical messengers, or ""neurotransmitters"" in these brain regions. The study authors suggest that modulating these neurotransmitters could be a fruitful target for developing drugs to treat mild TBI.

Next, the researchers plan to look at the effects of repetitive concussion, as often seen in sports, to see whether TBI has cumulative effects that could make the consequences of concussion increasingly serious with each knock to the head.

The MacBook Pro 16-inch on offer here comes with the M2 Pro chip, which is not only powerful but flexible, too - it can even run many iPad and iPhone apps, alongside everything a Mac can do (which is a lot, by the way).

Apple Silicon also means a lot of the key internal components are embedded on the same chip, so less power is used transferring data between them. This results in a drastically improved battery life over the prior Intel-based models.

Add to that a return of ports (there's a MagSafe connector that supports fast-charging, three USB-C ports, HDMI output and an SD card slot) and the small matter of the best laptop screen we've tested and you've got a terrific all-rounder.

We've not yet reviewed the M2 Pro model, but in our MacBook Pro 16-inch review, we gave it our highest rating, 5 out of 5 stars, saying that: “the MacBook Pro 16-inch is a powerful and stylish laptop that's ideal for resource-intensive tasks like programming, coding, and video editing.”

Given the jump in power here in the same form factor, it's a great option for coding on the go.

It was long thought that pyrite — a shiny mineral also known as fool's gold — was the special ingredient that gave fossils embedded in Germany's Posidonia Shale their golden glow. But now scientists think something else is causing these fossils to shimmer.

Earlier this year, a team of international researchers visited the Early Jurassic site known for its exceptionally well-preserved fossils of marine animals. They collected dozens of samples of fossilized ammonites, bivalves and crustaceans that were about palm-size or larger. 

Once the team viewed the roughly 183 million-year-old fossils using a high-powered scanning electron microscope, they struggled to find any pyrite in the fossils poking out of the black shale, according to a study published in the March 2023 edition of the journal Earth-Science Reviews

""It was long believed that everything [at the Posidonia Shale] was pyritized,"" study co-author Rowan Martindale
(opens in new tab)
, an associate professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, told Live Science. ""We picked samples that we thought for sure would be all pyrite. And lo and behold there was a little bit of pyrite on a couple of them, but basically it was all phosphatized or yellow calcite. It was pretty much a shock to all of us who worked on the paper.""

After analyzing roughly 70 specimens, it was clear that while the shale surrounding the fossils was ""dotted with microscopic clusters of pyrite crystals, called framboids,"" it was phosphate minerals with yellow calcite that were the source of the fossils' golden glow, according to a statement

""The framboids look like tiny raspberries,"" study co-author Sinjini Sinha
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral candidate in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT, told Live Science. ""After looking at the specimens under a microscope, I only found a few framboids on the fossils themselves but counted 600 to 800 on the surrounding shale.""

Knowing that pyrite and phosphate are present in different parts of the specimens is crucial since it reveals information about the fossilization environment. For example, pyrite forms in anoxic environments where there's no oxygen present, whereas phosphate minerals like yellow calcite need oxygen to form, according to the statement.

The research revealed that even though an anoxic seafloor ""set the stage for fossilization,"" it took a burst of oxygen to cause the chemical reactions necessary for fossilization to occur. The oxygenation combined with the phosphate minerals helped turn the fossils into what looks like gold, according to the statement.

Hidden oceans may lurk under the icy crusts of four of Uranus' moons. 

Scientists recently reanalyzed data from the Voyager spacecraft that flew by Uranus in the 1980s and found that four of Uranus' largest moons — Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon — may be warm enough to host liquid oceans. In Titania and Oberon, these oceans might even be warm enough to potentially support life, according to a recent study in the Journal of Geophysical Research
(opens in new tab)
. 

""When it comes to small bodies — dwarf planets and moons — planetary scientists previously have found evidence of oceans in several unlikely places, including the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and Saturn's moon Mimas,"" study lead author Julie Castillo-Rogez
(opens in new tab)
 of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""So there are mechanisms at play that we don't fully understand.""

The new study integrated 1980s Voyager 2 data with information on other icy moons such as Pluto's Charon and Saturn's Enceladus drawn from more recent NASA missions such as Galileo, Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons. Uranus has 27 moons, but the researchers focused on the five largest, which are Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon and Miranda. Of these, Ariel is the smallest at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, while Titania is the largest at 980 miles (1,580 km) across.

Previously, scientists thought only Tatiana was likely to generate any internal heat via radioactive decay — the process by which unstable atoms lose energy through radiation — believing the other moons to be too small. However, modeling the other moons' porosity suggested that all but Miranda are insulated enough to retain internal heat created by radioactive decay. The researchers also found that any potential oceans beneath the icy crusts of these moons would be rich in chlorides, ammonia and salts, both of which would lower the freezing point of the water. The combination of a low freezing point and enough internal heat could mean that Ariel, Umbrial, Titania and Oberon all have oceans dozens of miles deep within their interiors, the researchers reported.

In 2020, scientists detected some evidence of recent geological activity on Ariel
(opens in new tab)
, suggesting the possible movement of a potential inner ocean. Miranda also has surface features that look relatively fresh, according to the researchers, but their modeling suggests that if the moon did have a liquid ocean at some point, it is likely frozen by now. 

To find out if these hidden oceans really exist, scientists will have to get creative. Spectrometers that can detect wavelengths of light reflected by ammonia and chlorides could help prove the presence of these chemicals under the crusts. Scientists could also use instruments that can detect electrical currents carried by liquid water to probe beneath these moons' surfaces. New modeling studies on how these moons formed could also help researchers plan what kind of observations they will need to make in the future, Castillo-Rogez said.

""We need to develop new models for different assumptions on the origin of the moons in order to guide planning for future observations,"" she said.

A child in Maine who recently tested positive for measles may be the state's first case of the viral infection since 2019, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reported Friday
(opens in new tab)
 (May 5).

While the case still needs to be confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Maine's public health agencies are assuming the child is infectious and working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed.

The CDC recommends
(opens in new tab)
 that children receive their first dose of the MMR vaccine, which guards against measles, mumps and rubella, between 12 months and 15 months old. Children should get their second dose between 4 and 6 years old. Alternatively, the MMRV vaccine, which also guards against varicella (chickenpox), may be given following the same vaccination schedule.

One dose of either vaccine is roughly 93% protective against measles, and two doses are 97% protective, meaning there's a small chance of infection even after two doses. However, vaccinated individuals tend to have much milder cases of the disease than unvaccinated people do.

The Maine child with a positive measles test had received one dose of a measles vaccine. (Neither the child's age nor any of their symptoms, if they had any, were noted in the DHHS statement.)

""Anyone at these locations during these times should watch for symptoms for 21 days after their exposure,"" the statement reads. ""If you have symptoms, call a health care provider for instructions before going to the office or hospital to help prevent further spread of infection.""

Between Jan. 1 and April 28, 2023, a total of 10 measles cases were reported nationwide, the CDC reported

While playing outside her school in Norway, an 8-year-old girl found an unexpected treasure — not a lost ball or a discarded jump rope, but a flint dagger crafted by Stone Age people 3,700 years ago.

The student, identified only as Elise in a statement
(opens in new tab)
 translated from Norwegian, discovered the gray-brown dagger when she was playing in a rocky area by her school in Vestland County. ""I was going to pick up a piece of glass, and then the stone was there,"" she said in the statement. 

Elise showed the stone to her teacher, Karen Drange, who saw that the stone looked ancient. Drange contacted Vestland county council, and archaeologists from the county examined the artifact.

The nearly 5-inch-long (12 centimeters) tool is a rare find, Louise Bjerre Petersen
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist with Vestland county municipality, said in the translated statement. Flint, a hard sedimentary rock, does not naturally occur in Norway, so the dagger may have come from across the North Sea in Denmark, according to the statement.

This type of dagger is often found with sacrificial finds, the archaeologists added. To further investigate the area, the Vestland County Council and Vestland County's University Museum in Bergen, Norway's second-largest city, teamed up to explore the school's grounds. But they didn't find any other evidence dating back to the Stone Age, they said in the statement.

Based on its style, the dagger likely dates to the New Stone Age, or the Neolithic, a time when prehistoric humans shaped stone tools

 and began to rely on domesticated plants and animals, build permanent villages and develop crafts, such as pottery. In Norway, the Stone Age, which includes the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, lasted from 10000 B.C. to 1800 B.C., with a number of hunter-gatherers permanently settling down to farm around 2400 B.C., according to Talk Norway

, an educational website on Norway's history and cultural heritage.

The dagger will be cataloged and used in research at the University Museum. The artifact isn't the only Stone Age discovery to recently get attention in Norway. This past winter, the full-body reconstruction of a Stone Age teenager who lived 8,300 years ago went on display at the Hå Gamle Prestegard museum in southern Norway. The teen boy was likely part of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer group, but the details surrounding his death are a mystery; it appears he died alone leaning against a cave wall, as his remains had no indications of a burial.

Astronomers may have just found the remnants of some of the universe's very first stars. The chemical signatures of these faraway, 13-plus-billion-year-old objects are remarkably different from those of younger stars, like our sun. By studying them, scientists hope to shed light on how stars, galaxies and even basic elements form. 

The research, co-authored by University of Florence astrophysicist Stefania Salvadori
(opens in new tab)
, was published May 3 in The Astrophysical Journal
(opens in new tab)
. 

In the earliest days of the universe, only very simple elements such as hydrogen and helium were available. The first stars ignited from these elements alone. Over time, their white-hot cores gradually cooked simple atoms into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, magnesium and eventually metals. Later generations of stars formed from clouds of gas containing these heavier atoms, and today most of the stars scientists observe are rich in metals like iron. (Our sun is about 98% hydrogen and helium, but contains trace amounts of heavier elements like iron, neon and carbon.)

Nobody has observed the original metal-deficient stars directly; most of them probably fizzled out or exploded long ago. But scientists can still observe some of their dusty remains by setting their sights billions of light years away.

—The early universe was crammed with stars 10,000 times the size of our sun, new study suggests

Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), Salvadori and her team peered into three distant clouds of star-forming gas. On their own, these clouds wouldn't tell scientists very much, but incoming light from nearby quasars — extremely bright galactic cores formed by dust falling into a supermassive black hole — helped reveal the cloud's secrets. Based on which wavelengths of light the gas clouds absorbed, the team determined what elements the stellar remains were made of. 

Sure enough, the clouds were extremely poor in iron and other metallic elements, but rich in carbon, oxygen and magnesium — precisely what would have been left over after the first stars ran out of fuel and exploded, according to the researchers. This tracks with other research into the origins of stars, and may help explain the composition of younger stars, including those found in the Milky Way. 

""Our discovery opens new avenues to indirectly study the nature of the first stars, fully complementing studies of stars in our galaxy,"" Salvadori said in a statement

It's well known that the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin plays a key role in sleep. But other hormones, including the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone, can also affect our sleep — and potentially even our dreams. 

In particular, people may notice differences in the quality of their sleep and the way they dream at different stages of their menstrual cycle, experts told Live Science. Here's how the menstrual cycle might affect sleep and dreaming.

How the menstrual cycle affects sleep and dreams 

Sleep is broken down into stages, broadly known as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People dream during REM sleep, which usually begins about 90 minutes after a person falls asleep, said Dr. Tania Adib
(opens in new tab)
, a consultant gynecologist at The Lister Hospital in the U.K. 

NREM sleep is broken up into four stages: easily disturbed light sleep, a deeper intermediate sleep, and two stages of deep sleep, which occurs just before REM sleep, according to the Mayo Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. Deep sleep is the most restorative and where the body and brain have time to repair.

Estrogen and progesterone can affect how much time people spend in REM and NREM sleep and whether they wake up often while dreaming.

""There are lots of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the parts of the brain that regulate sleep, and because the levels of these hormones change during the menstrual cycle, it means our sleep also varies across the month,"" said Dr. Zoe Schaedel
(opens in new tab)
, co-founder of Myla Health, a private clinic for women experiencing menopause, perimenopause and reproductive health issues in England. 

The menstrual cycle has four stages: menses (when the period occurs), the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, according to the Cleveland Clinic
(opens in new tab)
. The menstrual cycle ""begins"" on the first day of a period. Prior to ovulation, which occurs roughly around day 14, estrogen levels rise, Schaedel told Live Science. ""Sleep tends to be better-quality in this phase, known as the follicular or proliferative phase.""  

After ovulation, progesterone levels then begin to rise and eventually overtake estrogen; if a pregnancy doesn't occur, the levels of both hormones drop in the lead-up to menstration. ""This is known as the 'luteal phase' and is where we see changes in the structure of sleep,"" Schaedel said.

Shifting progesterone levels during the luteal phase may partly cause disturbed sleep in the lead-up to a person's period, Schaedel said. 

Compared to estrogen, progesterone is thought to be more strongly tied to premenstrual symptoms (PMS), which occur during the luteal phase and commonly include insomnia or oversleeping, according to Mount Sinai.
(opens in new tab)
 These sleep changes aren't fully understood, but rising progesterone in the luteal phase is linked to increased body temperatures and sweating
(opens in new tab)
, which may interfere with sleep because normally, body temperatures decline before and during sleep. The overall ratio of REM to NREM sleep may also decrease during this phase, according to a 2021 review in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience
(opens in new tab)
. 

RELATED STORIES

—Do dreams really reveal our deepest secrets?

—Does the moon affect menstrual cycles?

—Why can't we remember our dreams?

Progesterone and estrogen help modulate chemical messengers in the brain — namely, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) — which regulate mood and stress levels, according to Mount Sinai. Anxiousness and depressed mood due to PMS may undermine people's attempts to fall asleep
(opens in new tab)
, and physical symptoms, like body aches and nausea, may also help explain why people experiencing PMS are prone to sleep disruptions, per the Frontiers in Neuroscience review. 

Melatonin production and sensitivity may also change during the luteal phase, some studies hint, but the research is ""not sufficient""
(opens in new tab)
 to draw strong conclusions.

Sleep disturbances in the luteal phase may increase the likelihood that individuals remember their vivid dreams, Schaedel said. 

""If sleep fragments REM, or you wake up shortly after the REM stage, you are far more likely to remember your dreams,"" Adib told Live Science.

One 2019 study hinted that hormones may also affect the types of dreams a person has
(opens in new tab)
. The study asked hundreds of women to recall the previous night's dreams. Of the women who could remember, those in the luteal phase more often reported their dreams as being ""pleasant,"" while those in other parts of the menstrual cycle were more likely to report their dreams being ""unpleasant."" 

However, it's unclear whether this result would carry over to other, larger groups of people.

A school of piranhas attacked holiday makers playing in a stream in a Brazilian resort on May 1, leaving at least eight people injured.

The fish tore at the bathers' legs and feet with their razor-sharp teeth, driving them out of the water and onto a tourist beach in Tarumã-Açu, a region northeast of Manaus, the capital city of the state of Amazonas.

Experts think the biting frenzy was a case of ""mistaken identity"" and that the piranhas were actually after the food that visitors at local restaurants sometimes throw into the river.

""Piranhas do not exhibit unprovoked attacks on humans,"" Steve Huskey
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of biology at Western Kentucky University, told Live Science in an email. ""The situation described is one of piranhas becoming acclimated to free food and those bites were just another example of mistaken identity, just like shark attacks.""

Some piranha species, including the red-bellied piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), engage in collective feeding frenzies. ""Species of the genus Pygocentrus, that occur in the Amazon and São Francisco river drainages, are most dangerous,"" Paulo Andreas Buckup
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist and professor at the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, told Live Science in an email.

But this behavior only occurs in exceptional circumstances, such as when a high number of fish are trapped in small pools or starved for a long time, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium
(opens in new tab)
. ""These fish swim in schools and normally do not attack large animals,"" Buckup said.

Related: Swarms of 'mini-shark' beach bugs are on a foot-biting rampage in California 

Most piranhas are harmless and the meat-eating species tend to scavenge rather than hunt living animals. ""Some species of the piranha family eat only fruit, insects and vegetable matter. Some specialize in eating fish scales and nibbling the fins of other fish,"" Buckup said. ""They may attack other live fish or animals, but they will eat dead flesh whenever it is available.""

The presence of bathers in a feeding spot, however, can lead to confusion and aggression. ""Feeding piranhas in a tourist setting strengthens their natural behaviors to school and bite,"" Mark Sabaj Perez
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, Philadelphia, told Live Science in an email.

The attack in Tarumã-Açu could have been triggered by a single piranha mistaking a foot for food, taking a mouthful and drawing blood, which in turn sparked a feeding frenzy. ""An attack is likely to have been caused by presence of blood in the water, skin injuries or movement that appears as a fish in distress,"" Buckup said. ""Because their teeth are so sharp, a single bite [could] cause a lot of bleeding and trigger group feeding frenzy behavior.""

Once the meal begins, piranhas dart in and out to bite their prey at great speed to avoid being accidentally nipped by another individual, according to the Sea Life London Aquarium.

Piranhas have the strongest bite recorded in bony fish — as powerful as a great white shark, according to a 2012 study published in the journal Scientific Reports
(opens in new tab)
. The black piranha (Serrasalmus rhombeus) generates a bite force equivalent to 35 times its body weight, compared to just one time its body weight for a great white, according to Huskey.

""When a piranha focuses that bite force onto their 14 razor-sharp teeth, the bite pressure climbs to immeasurable levels,"" Huskey said. ""They could do tremendous damage to humans throughout South America, if they were so inclined, but they're not… and they don't.""

A rock likely to be a meteorite crashed into a New Jersey home on Monday (May 8), damaging a bedroom but causing no injuries. 

No one was at Suzy Kop's home in Hopewell Township, New Jersey, when the space rock made its entrance, according to CBS News Philadelphia
(opens in new tab)
, which first reported the unusual event. The meteorite landed around 1 p.m. EDT, crashing through the roof and landing in the bedroom belonging to Kop's father. Judging by the damage, the meteorite hit the floor, bounced to the ceiling, and came to rest in the corner of a room. The metallic rock measures about 4 inches by 6 inches (10 by 15 centimeters). 

""I did touch the thing because I thought it was a random rock… and it was warm,"" Kop told CBS News.

Authorities are still investigating the origin of the apparent space rock, but Derrick Pitts
(opens in new tab)
, the chief astronomer at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, told CBS News that it could be four to five billion years old. It’s possible that the meteorite was part of the ongoing Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which roughly occurs between April 19 and May 29 each year, and which reached its peak around May 5 and 6. During peak days, the shower can produce hundreds of ""shooting stars"" per hour – most of which are meteors that burn up in the atmosphere. These meteors are the rocky debris left by Halley’s Comet, which becomes visible from Earth every 75 to 79 years, according to NASA

In February 2013, a meteor estimated at 59 feet (18 m) in diameter zinged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia.

Sleep apnea may be linked to certain indicators of worse brain health, according to a new study.

The study, published Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Neurology
(opens in new tab)
, looked at people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition where the upper throat muscles relax during sleep and block the airway. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sleep studies to examine if sleep apnea and altered sleep were associated with two kinds of unusual patterns in the brain's white matter — the insulated wires that extend from brain cells.

Both severe sleep apnea and reduced time spent in the deep stages of sleep were associated with these two biomarkers, which have each previously been linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or general cognitive decline, as well as having a stroke.

The researchers found ""a pretty significant association between slow-wave sleep duration, or deep sleep time, and these white matter measures,"" said Bryce Mander
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.

Related: Human brain looks years 'older' after just one night without sleep, small study shows 

The study included 140 people with OSA whose average age was about 73 years old. All the participants were screened for one of the two biomarkers, but only 103 were screened for the second, as well. The overall group was relatively evenly split between people with mild, moderate and severe OSA, and most people had no cognitive impairment during the study.

One of the biomarkers that the researchers looked for in brain scans were white matter hyperintensities, ""bright spots commonly seen in the white matter of the brain on MRI, which appear with aging and vascular disease,"" Dr. Diego Carvalho
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine and the senior author of the study, wrote in an email to Live Science. ""They represent areas of damage to the white matter.""

The second biomarker, called ""fractional anisotropy of the genu of the corpus callosum,"" is related to how water flows through brain cells' wires, or axons. Changes in this water flow, wrote Carvalho, are related to axon damage and can be an early sign of vascular disease. The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain and contains the organ's densest white matter. 

Using polysomnography, meaning the variety of data collected during a sleep study, the researchers found that participants who spent less time in slow-wave sleep appeared more affected by both types of biomarkers in their MRIs. Separately, people with severe OSA also appeared more impacted by white matter abnormalities than people with mild or moderate OSA. 

The research reveals associations between sleep apnea, deep sleep, and white matter abnormalities, but it can't say whether these sleep differences caused the abnormalities, or if differences in white matter could be interfering with sleep. It also could be that sleep and white matter abnormalities impact one another, said Mander, contributing to a vicious cycle of poor sleep quality and worse brain health.

""To me, I think that's the most likely outcome,"" he said.

One limitation of the study is that polysomnography data was only collected for the first few hours participants slept; people's sleep patterns might have differed later in the night. After their sleep study, anyone who met criteria for sleep apnea was given treatment in the form of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which can help keep the airway open. Carvalho said that data from this ""treatment phase"" wasn't included because differences in how people responded to the CPAP would have muddied the data.

MRIs and polysomnography were taken, on average, about 1.7 years apart, but researchers only collected each type of data at one point in time, offering only snapshots of patients' brains and sleep patterns and not how they might change over time. The study also did not follow participants to see who might go on to develop dementia.  

Mander said that future research should examine how sleep apnea's impact on rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage of sleep when most dreaming happens, might affect the brain. (Slow-wave sleep occurs in certain stages of non-REM sleep.) However, the new study introduces important ideas about ""how sleep apnea and sleep disturbance might be associated with cognitive decline,"" he said.

"about 22 hours ago","1st draft of a human 'pangenome' published, adding millions of 'building blocks' to the human reference genome","A new version of the human reference genome incorporates genetic data from 47 individuals from around the globe, deepening scientists' view into how genes work.","A new human reference ""pangenome"" includes DNA data from 47 people. (Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)

Scientists have published the first human ""pangenome"" — a full genetic sequence that incorporates genomes from not just one individual, but 47. 

These 47 individuals hail from around the globe and thus vastly increase the diversity of the genomes represented in the sequence, compared to the previous full human genome sequence that scientists use as their reference for study. The first human genome sequence was released with some gaps in 2003 and only made ""gapless"" in 2022. If that first human genome is a simple linear string of genetic code, the new pangenome is a series of branching paths.

The ultimate goal of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, which published the first draft of the pangenome on Wednesday (May 10) in the journal Nature
(opens in new tab)
, is to sequence at least 350 individuals from different populations around the world. Although 99.9% of the genome is the same from person to person, there is a lot of diversity found in that final 0.1%.

""Rather than using a single genome sequence as our coordinate system, we should instead have a representation that is based on the genomes of many different people so we can better capture genetic diversity in humans,"" Melissa Gymrek
(opens in new tab)
, a genetics researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the project, told Live Science. 

Related: More than 150 'made-from-scratch' genes are in the human genome. 2 are totally unique to us. 

The newly drafted human pangenome is a collection of different genomes from which to compare an individual genome sequence. Like a map of the subway system, the pangenome graph has many possible routes for a sequence to take, represented by the different colors.   The detouring paths at the top of the image represent single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which are single letter differences. The yellow path that loops around itself and repeats the same nucleotides represents a duplication variant. The pink path that loops counterclockwise and follows the nucleotide sequence backwards represents an inversion variant. At the bottom, the green and dark blue paths miss the C nucleotide in its route and represent a deletion variant. The light blue path, which has extra nucleotides in its route, represents an insertion variant. (Image credit: Darryl Leja, NHGRI)
A reference for health 

The first full human genome sequence was completed in 2003 by the Human Genome Project and was based on one person's DNA. Later, bits and pieces from about 20 other individuals were added, but 70% of the sequence scientists use to benchmark genetic variation still comes from a single person. 

Geneticists use the reference genome as a guide when sequencing pieces of people's genetic codes, Arya Massarat
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student in Gymrek's lab who co-authored an editorial about the new research with her in the journal Nature, told Live Science. They match the newly decoded DNA snippets to the reference to figure out how they fit within the genome as a whole. They also use the reference genome as a standard to pinpoint genetic variations — different versions of genes that diverge from the reference — that might be linked with health conditions. 

But with a single reference mostly from one person, scientists have only a limited window of genetic diversity to study.

The first pangenome draft now doubles the number of large genome variants, known as structural variants, that scientists can detect, bringing them up to 18,000. These are places in the genome where large chunks have been deleted, inserted or rearranged. The new draft also adds 119 million new base pairs, meaning the paired ""letters"" that make up the DNA sequence, and 1,115 new gene duplication mutations to the previous version of the human genome.

""It really is understanding and cataloging these differences between genomes that allow us to understand how cells operate and their biology and how they function, as well as understanding genetic differences and how they contribute to understanding human disease,"" study co-author Karen Miga
(opens in new tab)
, a geneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said at a press conference held May 9. 

The pangenome could help scientists get a better grasp of complex conditions in which genes play an influential role, such as autism, schizophrenia, immune disorders and coronary heart disease, researchers involved with the study said at the press conference. 

For example, the Lipoprotein A gene is known to be one of the biggest risk factors for coronary heart disease in African Americans, but the specific genetic changes involved are complex and poorly understood, study co-author Evan Eichler
(opens in new tab)
, a genomics researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle, told reporters. With the pangenome, researchers can now more thoroughly compare the variation in people with heart disease and without, and this could help clarify individuals' risk of heart disease based on what variants of the gene they carry. 

Related: As little as 1.5% of our genome is 'uniquely human'  

A diverse understanding 

The current pangenome draft used data from participants in the 1000 Genomes Project, which was the first attempt to sequence genomes from a large number of people from around the world. The included participants had agreed for their genetic sequences to be anonymized and included in publicly available databases. 

The new study also used advanced sequencing technology called ""long-read sequencing,"" as opposed to the short-read sequencing that came before. Short-read sequencing is what happens when you send your DNA to a company like 23andMe, Eichler said. Researchers read out small segments of DNA and then stitch them together into a whole. This kind of sequencing can capture a decent amount of genetic variation, but there can be poor overlap between each DNA fragment. Long-read sequencing, on the other hand, captures big segments of DNA all at once.

While it's possible to sequence a genome with short-read sequencing for about $500, long-read sequencing is still expensive, costing about $10,000 a genome, Eichler said. The price is coming down, however, and the pangenome team hopes to sequence their next batches of genomes at half that cost or less. 

The researchers are working to recruit new participants to continue to fill in diversity gaps in the pangenome, study co-author Eimear Kenny
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of medicine and genetics at  the Institute for Genomic Health at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told reporters. Because genetic information is sensitive and because different rules govern data-sharing and privacy in different countries, this is delicate work. Issues include privacy, informed consent, and the possibility of discrimination based on genetic information, Kenny said. 

Already, researchers are uncovering new genetic processes with the draft pangenome. In two papers published in Nature alongside the work, researchers looked at highly repetitive segments of the genome. These segments have traditionally been difficult to study, biochemist Brian McStay
(opens in new tab)
 of the National University of Ireland Galway, told Live Science, because sequencing them via short-read technology makes it hard to understand how they fit together. The long read technology allows for long chunks of these repetitive sequences to be read at once. 

The studies found that in one type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
, known as segmental duplications, there is a larger than expected amount of variation, potentially a mechanism for the long-term evolution of new functions for genes. In another type of repetitive sequence
(opens in new tab)
 that is responsible for building the cellular machines that create new proteins, though, the genome stays remarkably stable. The pangenome allowed researchers to discover a potential mechanism for how these key segments of DNA stay consistent over time.

""This is just the start,"" McStay said. ""There will be a whole lot of new biology that will come out of this.""

Humpback whales have — for the first time ever — been filmed rolling to and fro on sandy seabeds to scrub off dead skin and unwanted hitchhikers.

Footage captured by researchers in the Gold Coast Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia, shows the gigantic marine mammals performing full and side ""sand rolls"" up to 164 feet (50 meters) below the ocean's surface to shed parasites that live on their skin, known as ectoparasites, which can make the whales less hydrodynamic.

""We believe that the whales exfoliate using the sand to assist with molting and removal of ectoparasites, such as barnacles, and specifically select areas suitable for this behavior,"" Olaf Meynecke
(opens in new tab)
, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia who led the research, said in a statement

Although humpback whales have been spotted hovering and feeding near the seafloor before, this is the first time researchers have recorded them rolling in the sand. A 2016 study published in the journal Marine Biodiversity Records
(opens in new tab)
 suggested that humpbacks used the seabed for hygienic purposes, but the reported sightings were opportunistic and made from a boat rather than underwater.

Related: Whale sighting in Australia hints at 'extremely unusual' interspecies adoption 

Barnacles are sturdy little crustaceans related to lobsters and shrimp. They cement themselves to other sea creatures with one of the most powerful known natural glues, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ocean Service
(opens in new tab)
. Whales need to remove these crusty parasites to stay streamlined and preserve energy, according to a study describing the sand rolling behavior, published March 12 in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering
(opens in new tab)
.

The whales picked a shallow, sandy location near their migration route to exfoliate, moving head first through the substrate while they rolled. The density of parasites is generally higher around the face than elsewhere, so getting rid of them requires a rigorous rub, according to the study.

The researchers tagged three humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) between August 2021 and October 2022 using suction-cup sensors that recorded high-definition video, as well as light, pressure, temperature and GPS data. The animals were on their summer migration path from tropical breeding grounds near the Great Barrier Reef, to cooler feeding grounds in Antarctica.

While they cannot exclude the possibility that the whales were trying to scratch off the tags, the researchers note that other individuals that were not tagged were also seen rolling across the seabed in the new footage. The tagged humpbacks also did not seem to be targeting the skin carrying the sensors.

The whale exfoliation also provided a tasty snack for small fish called silver trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus), which were seen feeding on dead skin flakes just after the sand rolls.

As well as staying streamlined, exfoliating on the seabed could help humpbacks maintain healthy skin. 

""Humpback whales host diverse communities of skin bacteria that can pose a threat for open wounds if bacteria grow in large numbers,"" Meynecke said. ""Removing excess skin is likely a necessity to maintain a healthy bacterial skin community."" Humpbacks remove some barnacles and skin via breaches — where a whale leaps from the water — but not all, he said.

Rolling around could also be a social activity related to play or relaxation. ""During the different deployments, the sand rolling was observed in the context of socializing,"" Meynecke said. ""The behavior was either following courtship, competition or other forms of socializing."" Other whale species, including bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) are known to rub against rocks, pebbles and mud on the seafloor to shed excess skin.

If you're looking for a quality fitness tracker for yourself or a family member, and want to save some money, we've found a great Fitbit Charge 5 deal for you. Amazon have knocked a fantastic 32% off the retail price
(opens in new tab)
, bringing this best Fitbit down to $102: there has never been a better time to join the Fitbit club!

We've tested this model extensively, and you can read our Fitbit Charge 5 review to get a better understanding of what it's all about. If you just want to know if it's any good... well, it is listed in our guide to the best fitness trackers — and for good reason. The Fitbit model comes with full GPS, an ECG feature, and it's one of the few Fitbits that has a clever EDA sensor, which can measure stress. The only other models that offer this are the more high-end trackers in Fitbit's range, like the Versa and the Sense, which right now cost around $100 more.

If you're not convinced whether you want a Charge 5 or a different Fitbit altogether, we've done some handy comparisons to help you decide: Fitbit Charge 4 vs Charge 5 and Fitbit Inspire 3 vs Fitbit Charge 5.

Fitbit Charge 5 | Was $149.95, Now $102.00 on Amazon
Save a brilliant 32% on one of the top fitness trackers on the market. Coming with a 7-day battery life, built-in GPS, advanced health features like an ECG and EDA function along with the ability to track your sleep, this stellar fitness band is suitable for most people. 

VIEW DEAL

Our favorite features of this model are the sleep tracking options, the heart rate monitor, built-in GPS, and the handy stress management sensor. 

Plus, if you do take the plunge but decide that the Fitbit Charge 5 isn't right for you (or your loved one), you can always return the wearable, as long as it hasn't been used. 

Here at Live Science, we've tried and tested many great fitness trackers and some of the best running watches for both the US and UK markets, from the likes of Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit. 

So we speak from experience when we say that the Charge 5 is one of the best models for anyone looking to pick up their first fitness tracker. It has all the features you need to really hone both your fitness and wellness routine, without breaking the bank. The band comes in three different colors: graphite black, lunar white and steel blue, so it'll suit most workout outfits.

We appreciate some of the enhanced personal safety features too, like the GPS, which allows for phone-free route tracking; and the ECG sensor which analyses your heart rhythm to check for abnormalities. But if we're honest, it's the impressive EDA stress sensor that Fitbit introduced into the watch that makes it stand out from the crowd. Who wouldn't want to track and stay on top of their stress levels?

It does also come with blood oxygenation readings and fitness plans. If you pay the $102 price tag today, the watch includes a 6-month Fitbit Premium trial, although you'll need to pay an extra $9.99 a month thereafter to access these features.

Shark attacks are extremely rare
(opens in new tab)
 — you're unlikely to meet one in the flesh, let alone be bitten. But during World War II, the sinking of a U.S. Navy ship led to one of the most infamous shark attacks in history and the deaths of hundreds of men, with the explosion drawing in the apex predators and sparking a feeding frenzy that lasted for days.

In July 1945, the USS Indianapolis had completed a trip to a naval base on the Pacific island of Tinian to deliver uranium and other components that would be used to create the atomic bomb ""Little Boy."" The first nuclear weapon ever used in wartime, it would later be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

After delivering the parts, the Indianapolis departed for the Philippines on training duty. Shortly after midnight on July 30, the ship was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, causing massive damage. It began to take on huge amounts of water, and sank in just 12 minutes. Of the 1,195 men
(opens in new tab)
 on board, around 300 went down with the ship, but nearly 900 were left adrift in the open ocean.

Many died of exposure, dehydration and saltwater poisoning. However, according to Smithsonian Magazine, up to 150 sailors and crew are estimated to have been killed by sharks — in what is considered the worst shark attack in history. But why?

Dangerous sharks and how they hunt

Unlike some other predators, such as lions and wolves, most sharks hunt alone, Nico Booyens, a marine biologist and director of research at the Shark Research Unit
(opens in new tab)
 in South Africa, told Live Science in an email. ""Different shark species have different hunting techniques, but many sharks are solitary predators that rely on their senses of sight, smell and electroreception to locate their prey.""

Sharks also have a special system called a lateral line
(opens in new tab)
 that picks up the vibrations in the water, Booyens says. This sensory ability would have allowed them to detect the movement of the men in the water as they thrashed around to stay afloat. Once the sharks had located the sailors, they stood little chance of survival — especially those who were injured.

Related: In rare attack, great white shark decapitates diver in Mexico. But why?

According to survivor accounts, many victims were attacked near the surface of the water. This has since led to suggestions that oceanic whitetip sharks
(opens in new tab)
 (Carcharhinus longimanus) were the involved in the attacks because they are a surface-dwelling species
(opens in new tab)
.

""When a shark has located its prey, it will often use its sharp teeth and powerful jaws to bite and tear chunks of flesh from the prey,"" Booyens added. ""Some sharks, like the tiger shark [Galeocerdo cuvier], are known for their ability to swallow their prey whole, while others, like the bull shark [Carcharhinus leucas], will attack and bite their prey repeatedly until it is weakened or immobilized.""

Although oceanic whitetips are at the top of the food chain, their meals can be few and far between, so they are often opportunistic feeders. According to the Florida Museum
(opens in new tab)
, the species is often the first to appear at the site of oceanic disasters, and was also a major cause of fatalities after the sinking of the RMS Nova Scotia in 1942. The species is known to be persistent, unpredictable and shows little fear, making it particularly dangerous to humans, the Florida Museum said.

The worst shark attack in history

At the USS Indianapolis, the bodies of the dead and the injured were picked off first. Survivor Corporal Edgar Harrell told the Indianapolis Star
(opens in new tab)
 in 2014: ""That first morning, we had sharks."" As men got separated they would be targeted,"" he explained. ""You hear a blood-curdling scream. And then the body would go under, and then that life vest popped back up.""

The men were too scared to eat or move, for fear of being preyed upon. According to the report of a survivor, one of the sailors opened a can of Spam, the primary ration at the time, but was surrounded by sharks, resulting in a ""feeding frenzy.""

""Feeding frenzies typically occur when there is a sudden abundance of food, such as when a large school of fish is trapped in a small area,"" Booyens said. ""The scent of blood and the thrashing of prey can trigger a feeding frenzy, causing sharks to swarm and compete for the available food.""

The survivors of the USS Indianapolis were at sea for four days before rescue teams arrived.  (Image credit: PhotoQuest/Getty Images)

Many species of shark may engage in frenzied hunting, during which they can become very aggressive and attack each other as well as the prey. However, oceanic whitetips’ opportunistic feeding behavior — as well as their size and strength — made them particularly dangerous for the sailors. ""Feeding frenzies can be dangerous for humans who happen to be in the water, as the sharks may not be able to distinguish between prey and people,"" Booyens added.

For four days, no rescue arrived. Although the U.S. Navy had received word that a Japanese submarine had sunk a U.S. vessel, the message was believed to be fake — in an attempt to lure American rescue boats into a trap. Meanwhile, the survivors tried to stay alive by floating in groups, but in the scorching heat, many succumbed to dehydration. Others died from hypernatremia — too much sodium in the blood — from being forced to drink the salty seawater.

Eventually, a Navy plane flying overhead spotted the Indianapolis survivors and radioed for help. Food, water and rafts were dropped for the surviving men, before a seaplane was landed by Lt. Adrian Marks to rescue some of the survivors from the sharks. Finally, the USS Cecil J. Doyle helped to pull the remaining survivors from the water. Only 316 men survived.

"1 day ago","Some of the 1st ice age humans who ventured into Americas came from China, DNA study suggests","The first wave of humans into the Americas during the last ice age may have hailed partly from northern China, according to a DNA study of ancient and modern Indigenous people.","Some of the first ice age people who ventured into the Americas hailed from northern China. (Image credit: SrdjanPav via Getty Images)

Ice age groups in the ancient northern coast of China helped make up the first wave of people to settle the New World, a new DNA study suggests.

The ancient groups may have also migrated to Japan, potentially helping explain similarities in Stone Age artifacts in the Americas, China and Japan, according to the study, published Tuesday (May 9) in the journal Cell Reports
(opens in new tab)
.

There are two leading models as to how people first migrated to the Americas. The older idea suggests that ancient Siberians made this journey when the Bering Land Bridge — the landmass that once connected Asia with North America — was relatively free of ice. More recent evidence argues that multiple waves of humans journeyed to the Americas from various parts of Eurasia, perhaps on watercraft along the Pacific coasts of Asia, the Bering Land Bridge and North America.

To shed light on the origins of Indigenous Americans, scientists examined DNA from mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria possess their own genes, which are passed down from the mother.

The researchers analyzed more than 100,000 contemporary and 15,000 ancient DNA samples from across Eurasia. They focused on a rare mitochondrial DNA lineage called D4h, which is currently found in only about 1 in 200 people worldwide.

Related: Modern humans migrated into Europe in 3 waves, 'ambitious and provocative' new study suggests

""This genetic type had only been sporadically reported in different studies,"" study lead author Yu-Chun Li
(opens in new tab)
, a molecular anthropologist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China, told Live Science in an email. ""Therefore, this female lineage, as well as its origin and dispersal history — especially its dispersal into the Americas — gained little attention until now."" 

Previous research
(opens in new tab)
 found that one branch of D4h, known as D4h3a, was seen in Indigenous Americans, while another offshoot named D4h3b was detected in China and Thailand. This suggested that ancient members of the D4h lineage might help bridge Asia and the Americas.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (26,500 to 19,000 years ago), ice age humans with the maternal lineage D4h3a left Asia and likely crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

""The most difficult work was to collect as many samples belonging to D4h as we could,"" study senior author Qing-Peng Kong
(opens in new tab)
, an evolutionary geneticist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, told Live Science in an email.

By comparing mutations seen in mitochondrial DNA over time, as well as the geographic locations and radiocarbon dates of the fossils from which ancient DNA was collected, the scientists found D4h3a likely originated in northern coastal China.

""The ancestral sources of Native Americans in Asia are more complicated than previously indicated,"" Li said.

The new findings suggest that the ancestors and closest relatives of D4h3a entered the Americas through at least two migrations. Both diasporas apparently occurred when the land bridge from Asia to the Americas was obstructed by ice, so the researchers suggest that ice age people may have traveled via the Pacific coast instead. 

The first migration likely happened between 19,500 and 26,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest part of the last ice age, the researchers said. Back then, ice sheets covered much of the planet, and living in northern China would have likely proven difficult for humans.

During the last deglaciation (19,000 to 11,500 years ago), people from what is now northern China likely journeyed to Japan. (Image credit: Li et al. Cell Reports (2023); (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0))

The scientists estimated the second event apparently occurred between 19,000 and 11,500 years ago, when the ice sheets began melting. Prior work suggested this climate shift likely helped support the rapid growth seen in human populations during this era, which may have helped drive their spread into other regions.

Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that during the second wave, one lineage branched out from northern coastal China and traveled to Japan, where they contributed to the Japanese gene pool, especially the indigenous Ainu people. ""This points to an unexpected genetic link between Native Americans and the Japanese,"" Kong said.

In all, the new study ""matches well with what we know about the archaeological record of Japan, and lends weight to current models of how humans came to populate the Americas,"" Loren Davis
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis who did not take part in this research, told Live Science in an email.

—Unknown lineage of ice age Europeans discovered in genetic study

—Prehistoric population once lived in Siberia, but mysteriously vanished, genetic study finds

—Humans crossed the Bering Land Bridge to people the Americas. Here's what it looked like 18,000 years ago.

This discovery may help explain some archeological similarities that prior work controversially suggested at times existed between Stone Age peoples in China, Japan and the Americas. Specifically, researchers had argued the three regions possessed similarities in how they crafted ""stemmed projectile points"" for arrowheads and spears. 

Although the scientists focused on mitochondrial DNA, additional genetic analyses they conducted suggest that male ancestors of Indigenous Americans also lived in northern China at about the same time as these female ancestors.

However, while the new study is exciting, it's just ""another piece of the puzzle,"" on how and when ice age humans first populated the Americas, Davis said. For instance, the researchers stressed that while these new findings suggest this single northern Chinese lineage may have contributed to Indigenous American ancestry, ""it does not represent the whole history of all Native Americans,"" Li said. ""Investigating other lineages showing genetic connections between Asia and the Americas will help obtain the whole picture of the history of Native Americans.""

Earth probably shouldn't exist. 

That's because the orbits of the inner solar system planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are chaotic, and models have suggested that these inner planets should have crashed into each other by now. And yet, that hasn't happened.

New research published May 3 in the journal Physical Review X
(opens in new tab)
 may finally explain why.

Through a deep plunge into the models for planetary motion, the researchers discovered that the motions of the inner planets are constrained by certain parameters that act as a tether that inhibits the system's chaos. Besides providing a mathematical explanation for the apparent harmony in our solar system, the new study's insights may help scientists understand the trajectories of exoplanets surrounding other stars. 

Unpredictable planets

Planets constantly exert a mutual gravitational pull on each other – and these little tugs constantly make minor adjustments to the planets' orbits. The outer planets, which are much larger, are more resistant to little tugs and so maintain comparatively stable orbits. 

The problem of inner planet trajectories, however, is still too complicated to solve exactly. In the late 19th century, mathematician Henri Poincaré proved that it is mathematically impossible to solve the equations governing the motion for three or more interacting objects, often known as the ""three body problem."" As a result, uncertainties in the details of the planets' starting positions and velocities balloon over time. In other words: It is possible to take two scenarios in which the distances between Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth differ by the slightest amount, and in one the planets smash into each other and in another they veer apart. 

An illustration of two rocky planets colliding (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)

The time it takes for two trajectories with almost identical starting conditions to diverge by a specific amount is known as the Lyapunov time of the chaotic system. In 1989, Jacques Laskar
(opens in new tab)
, astronomer and research director at the National Center for Scientific Research and Paris Observatory and a co-author of the new study, calculated the characteristic Lyapunov time 
(opens in new tab)
for the planetary orbits of the inner solar system was just 5 million years. 

""It means basically that you lose one digit every 10 million years,"" Laskar, told Live Science. So, for example if the initial uncertainty in the position of a planet is 15 meters, 10 million years later this uncertainty would be 150 meters; after 100 million years, a further 9 digits are lost, giving an uncertainty of 150 million kilometers, equivalent to the distance between Earth and the sun. ""Basically you have no idea where the planet is,"" said Laskar.

While 100 million years may seem long, the solar system itself is over 4.5 billion years old, and the lack of dramatic events — such as a planetary collision or a planet being ejected from all this chaotic motion — long puzzled scientists. 

Laskar then looked at the problem in a different way: by simulating the inner planet trajectories over the next 5 billion years, stepping from one moment to the next. He found just a 1% chance of a planetary collision. With the same approach, he calculated that it would take, on average, about 30 billion years for any of the planets to collide. 

Reining in the chaos

Delving through the math, Laskar and his colleagues then identified for the first time ""symmetries"" or ""conserved quantities"" in the gravitational interactions that create a ""practical barrier in the chaotic wandering of the planets,"" Laskar said. 

These emergent quantities remain nearly constant and inhibit certain chaotic motions, but don't prevent them altogether, much like the raised lip of a dinner plate will inhibit food falling off the plate but not prevent it completely. We can thank these quantities for our solar system's apparent stability.

Renu Malhotra
(opens in new tab)
, Professor of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study, highlighted how subtle the mechanisms identified in the study are. Malhotra told Live Science that it is interesting that ""our solar system's planetary orbits exhibit exceptionally weak chaos."" 

In other work, Laskar and colleagues are searching for clues as to whether the number of planets in the solar system ever differed from what we currently see. For all the stability evident today, whether that has always been the case over the billions of years before life evolved remains an open question.

"1 day ago","Scientists discovered a 2,200-year-old condor poop pile in the Andes. Here's what it told them.","Scientists dug into a 2,200-year-old pile of Andean condor poop to study the species’ diet and changes in habitat.","For thousands of years, Andean condors have frequented a cliffside nest, resulting in a ring-shaped guano deposit that continues to increase year after year. A condor chick can be seen in the background. (Image credit: L. Sympson)

For the past 2,200 years, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), among the largest known flying birds in the world, have been nesting — and pooping — at a cliffside grotto in northern Patagonia, Argentina. Now researchers are studying the massive pile of guano to learn more about the threatened species and how it has adapted to its environment over time. 

To study the doughnut-shaped poop mound, which measures roughly 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter, researchers carved it like a pie, removing a single 10-inch-deep (25 centimeters) slice of excrement. Thanks to the deposit's location inside the grotto, the preserved poo had been well protected from wind and rain, allowing it to amass for thousands of years, according to a study published May 3 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B
(opens in new tab)
.

""By looking at the different layers, we could go back in time,"" lead study author Matthew Duda
(opens in new tab)
, a graduate student of biology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, told Live Science. ""We carbon dated [the pile] to figure out the nest's age, which is over 2,000 years old.""

By examining the preserved poo, the team discovered how the condors' diets had evolved over time.

""Condors are scavengers, and at one time they would fly along the shores and eat carcasses of whales and native species such as llamas and alpacas,"" Duda said. ""But as livestock like sheep and cattle were introduced into South America [by Europeans], their diets changed along with it. We saw a complete shift from before to what is currently most abundant for them to eat.""

Related: Critically endangered condor chicks are species' 1st known 'virgin births'

Unfortunately, this shift also meant the condors are ingesting more lead, which Duda attributed to ""lead shot being used to kill vermin, which the condors would then eat."" These toxic metals were then excreted by the birds.

""We saw that the concentration of lead was significantly higher now than in the past,"" Duda said.

This is particularly concerning since Andean condors are on the Red List of Threatened Species monitored by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
(opens in new tab)
, and their numbers continue to dwindle with only about 6,700 adults still living in the wild.

The researchers also noticed that for one 1,000-year stretch of time, roughly between 650 and 1,650 years ago, the condors more or less abandoned the site, resulting in the guano accumulation dropping drastically from approximately 3 cubic feet (0.08 cubic m) per year to 0.11 cubic feet (0.003 cubic m) per year. They think that increased volcanic activity forced the condors to leave, according to the study.

""We measured an increase in sulfur and sodium, which are both associated with volcanic activity,"" said Duda, who suspects that as volcanic ash blanketed the surrounding vegetation, herbivores were forced to leave in search of new food resources, causing the condors to take flight too.

""It is clear that quality breeding sites are critical for this species' survival,"" the study authors wrote in their paper. ""To support effective conservation efforts, nesting and roosting sites need extensive protection.""

A new species of deep-sea shark with bright white eyes has finally been identified, decades after a dead pregnant female of the species was first collected off the coast of Western Australia. The ""ghost"" shark was initially misidentified, and was only pegged as a new species after scientists took a second look at its bizarre egg cases that had languished in museum storage for years.

The newfound species, which was described in a new study published April 23 in the Journal of Fish Biology
(opens in new tab)
, has been named Apristurus ovicorrugatus, which is derived from the Latin for egg, ""ovi,"" and ""corrugatus,"" meaning corrugated, in reference to the corrugated egg cases that led to the species' discovery. 

The pregnant female, which was caught in 1992 and held in a museum collection, was carrying a single egg case.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

Along with its unique egg cases, A. ovicorrugatus also possesses unusual, shiny white irises.

""This is not a common feature for a deepwater species and only one other species, Apristurus nakayai from New Caledonia and PNG [Papua New Guinea] shares this character,"" study lead author Will White
(opens in new tab)
, an ichthyologist with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), told Live Science in an email.

Apristurus is a genus of catshark. They are commonly known as ghost or demon catsharks
(opens in new tab)
. It is one of the most diverse shark genera in the world, with around 40 known species. 

While the majority of shark species give birth to live young, the rest are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. The egg cases — also known as mermaid's purses — often have long tendrils that allow them to attach to seaweed or rocks.

In 2011, researchers came across an extremely strange egg case
(opens in new tab)
 containing a shark embryo. It was clear the shark belonged to the Apristurus genus, but the egg case did not match any known species. 

For over a decade, the egg case remained a mystery, until scientists found two more sitting in the Australian National Fish Collection, which falls under the CSIRO umbrella. 

""The egg cases possessed very distinctive longitudinal ridges on their surfaces which were T-shaped in cross-section,"" White said. ""Only one other species in the world has been found to have egg cases with that form of ridging and that is a different genus entirely."" 

A late-term embryo was found inside one of the egg cases examined.  (Image credit: White et al/Journal of Fish Biology)

White and his colleagues then trawled through their collection database to see if any other unidentified Apristurus specimens had been found in the small region where the egg cases had been collected. They eventually found the pregnant female: a 1.5 foot-long (46.7 centimeters) shark that had been misidentified as a South China catshark (Apristurus sinensis). 

The female was carrying a single egg case — and it matched the one they'd found a decade ago.

""Luckily the female specimen we found contained an identically ridged egg case and confirmed our suspicions,"" White said. 

Researchers say the discovery of A. ovicorrugatus highlights the importance of egg case shape to identifying species. In Australia, members of the public are invited to upload images of egg cases to a global database
(opens in new tab)
, allowing scientists to better understand where egg-laying sharks are breeding. The A. ovicorrugatus egg cases were found attached to corals, suggesting the species may rely on these organisms for reproduction.

Going forward, White and colleagues are scouring museum collections for more new species to see what else curators have overlooked or misidentified.

"2 days ago","Even mild concussions can 'rewire' the brain, possibly causing long-term symptoms","After a mild concussion, parts of the brain can become ""hyperconnected,"" and this may contribute to patients' long-lasting symptoms.","Gary Neville of the Manchester United Football Club holds his head after a collision with Dion Dublin of Aston Villa during a match held in March 2003. (Image credit: Offside / Contributor via Getty Images)

Even light bumps on the head can cause long-term problems, and researchers may now have an idea why: The brain's wiring can change in the aftermath of mild concussions.   

Prior studies suggested that even mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that don't cause any observable structural damage can still trigger symptoms that persist for more than six months. These symptoms range from problems with concentration and fatigue to depression and anxiety. 

Now, Rebecca Woodrow
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student at the University of Cambridge's Division of Anaesthesia, and her colleagues report that there can sometimes be an increase in the connectivity of the brain immediately after mild TBI that may help to predict and explain these long-lasting symptoms.

An estimated 50 million new TBI cases
(opens in new tab)
 are reported worldwide each year and this figure has been increasing. The trend prompted scientists to launch CENTER-TBI, a European Union-funded project aimed at improving care for TBI patients.  

Related: Concussions damage the 'bridge' between the two halves of the brain 

The recent study, published in February in the journal Brain
(opens in new tab)
, used CENTER-TBI data and found that, even for mild TBI, in which the patient is expected to make a full recovery within six months, problems often persist beyond that point.

""We were surprised at how many of these patients have a poor outcome,"" Woodrow, the study's first author, told Live Science. ""It was almost half."" 

Although there are treatments available for patients in intensive care for moderate to severe TBI, the understanding of mild TBI and its long-lasting symptoms remains poor, Woodrow said, adding, ""There is limited care for those symptoms, little support for these patients."" 

The brain changes identified in the new study hint at a way of identifying which patients will likely suffer long-lasting symptoms, as well as possible targets for drugs that may aid the recovery.

Woodrow and colleagues analyzed data from 108 TBI patients and 76 controls. This data included not just standard MRI and CT scans, which show brain structure, but also functional MRI (fMRI) scans, which provide data about brain function and are not usually collected for mild TBI. fMRI reveals the regions that have activity levels changing in sync, which are then inferred to be functionally connected. 

The CENTER-TBI dataset is unique because, in addition to brain scans, it includes behavioral data, clinical outcomes and biomarkers, co-senior author Emmanuel Stamatakis
(opens in new tab)
, whose University of Cambridge lab specializes in developing methods to understand fMRI data, told Live Science in an email. ""This makes it feasible to relate brain function to observed behaviour,"" he said.

Although the CT and standard MRI scans didn't reveal structural changes in the TBI patients' brains, the fMRIs showed significantly higher connectivity between the thalamus and the rest of the brain, compared with the healthy controls.  

Related: This blood test can detect brain injuries, but some doctors say it might be pointless

The thalamus is often described as the ""relay"" of the brain because many signals pass through the structure before being shuttled elsewhere. The thalamus is involved in not only primary sensory functions, such as seeing and smelling, but also various complex functions that activate multiple brain regions simultaneously, like concentrating, Woodrow said.

It may be that the brain adapts to injury in other areas of the brain by increasing their connections to the thalamus. Woodrow pointed out that the thalamus' position at the center of the brain also makes it vulnerable to injury from impacts, whatever direction they come from, so the increased connectivity could also be a response to direct thalamus injury.

Increased connectivity across the brain has already been identified in moderate and severe TBI, and in their new study, the authors noted that several past
(opens in new tab)
 studies
(opens in new tab)
 ""support this adaptive hyperconnectivity hypothesis."" 

""We can't claim to fully understand why it happens yet,"" said Stamatakis. Some scientists theorize that, immediately after mild TBI, the brain becomes hyperconnected, but that connectivity later dwindles and becomes lower than usual, in the long-term. 

But Woodrow explained that in mild TBI, it was thought that such hyperconnectivity effects may be much subtler than that seen in severe TBI and not significantly different from the varying connectivity levels normally seen from person to person. Past fMRI studies of mild injuries used small sample sizes of around 20 to 40 people, which limited their ability to identify a trend above baseline noise. 

The current study includes ""the largest sample studied with resting-state functional MRI in mild injury,"" Stamatakis said.

The study showed that not only is it possible to identify connectivity changes in the wake of mild TBI, but that regions where this hyperconnectivity is most prominent correlate with particular symptom types, such as emotional versus cognitive. These connectivity changes also correlate with concentrations of chemical messengers, or ""neurotransmitters"" in these brain regions. The study authors suggest that modulating these neurotransmitters could be a fruitful target for developing drugs to treat mild TBI.

Next, the researchers plan to look at the effects of repetitive concussion, as often seen in sports, to see whether TBI has cumulative effects that could make the consequences of concussion increasingly serious with each knock to the head.

Apple Silicon also means a lot of the key internal components are embedded on the same chip, so less power is used transferring data between them. This results in a drastically improved battery life over the prior Intel-based models.

Add to that a return of ports (there's a MagSafe connector that supports fast-charging, three USB-C ports, HDMI output and an SD card slot) and the small matter of the best laptop screen we've tested and you've got a terrific all-rounder.

We've not yet reviewed the M2 Pro model, but in our MacBook Pro 16-inch review, we gave it our highest rating, 5 out of 5 stars, saying that: “the MacBook Pro 16-inch is a powerful and stylish laptop that's ideal for resource-intensive tasks like programming, coding, and video editing.”

Given the jump in power here in the same form factor, it's a great option for coding on the go.

It was long thought that pyrite — a shiny mineral also known as fool's gold — was the special ingredient that gave fossils embedded in Germany's Posidonia Shale their golden glow. But now scientists think something else is causing these fossils to shimmer.

Earlier this year, a team of international researchers visited the Early Jurassic site known for its exceptionally well-preserved fossils of marine animals. They collected dozens of samples of fossilized ammonites, bivalves and crustaceans that were about palm-size or larger. 

Once the team viewed the roughly 183 million-year-old fossils using a high-powered scanning electron microscope, they struggled to find any pyrite in the fossils poking out of the black shale, according to a study published in the March 2023 edition of the journal Earth-Science Reviews

""It was long believed that everything [at the Posidonia Shale] was pyritized,"" study co-author Rowan Martindale
(opens in new tab)
, an associate professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, told Live Science. ""We picked samples that we thought for sure would be all pyrite. And lo and behold there was a little bit of pyrite on a couple of them, but basically it was all phosphatized or yellow calcite. It was pretty much a shock to all of us who worked on the paper.""

After analyzing roughly 70 specimens, it was clear that while the shale surrounding the fossils was ""dotted with microscopic clusters of pyrite crystals, called framboids,"" it was phosphate minerals with yellow calcite that were the source of the fossils' golden glow, according to a statement

""The framboids look like tiny raspberries,"" study co-author Sinjini Sinha

, a doctoral candidate in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT, told Live Science. ""After looking at the specimens under a microscope, I only found a few framboids on the fossils themselves but counted 600 to 800 on the surrounding shale.""

Knowing that pyrite and phosphate are present in different parts of the specimens is crucial since it reveals information about the fossilization environment. For example, pyrite forms in anoxic environments where there's no oxygen present, whereas phosphate minerals like yellow calcite need oxygen to form, according to the statement.

The research revealed that even though an anoxic seafloor ""set the stage for fossilization,"" it took a burst of oxygen to cause the chemical reactions necessary for fossilization to occur. The oxygenation combined with the phosphate minerals helped turn the fossils into what looks like gold, according to the statement.

Hidden oceans may lurk under the icy crusts of four of Uranus' moons. 

Scientists recently reanalyzed data from the Voyager spacecraft that flew by Uranus in the 1980s and found that four of Uranus' largest moons — Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon — may be warm enough to host liquid oceans. In Titania and Oberon, these oceans might even be warm enough to potentially support life, according to a recent study in the Journal of Geophysical Research
(opens in new tab)
. 

""When it comes to small bodies — dwarf planets and moons — planetary scientists previously have found evidence of oceans in several unlikely places, including the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and Saturn's moon Mimas,"" study lead author Julie Castillo-Rogez
(opens in new tab)
 of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""So there are mechanisms at play that we don't fully understand.""

The new study integrated 1980s Voyager 2 data with information on other icy moons such as Pluto's Charon and Saturn's Enceladus drawn from more recent NASA missions such as Galileo, Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons. Uranus has 27 moons, but the researchers focused on the five largest, which are Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon and Miranda. Of these, Ariel is the smallest at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, while Titania is the largest at 980 miles (1,580 km) across.

Previously, scientists thought only Tatiana was likely to generate any internal heat via radioactive decay — the process by which unstable atoms lose energy through radiation — believing the other moons to be too small. However, modeling the other moons' porosity suggested that all but Miranda are insulated enough to retain internal heat created by radioactive decay. The researchers also found that any potential oceans beneath the icy crusts of these moons would be rich in chlorides, ammonia and salts, both of which would lower the freezing point of the water. The combination of a low freezing point and enough internal heat could mean that Ariel, Umbrial, Titania and Oberon all have oceans dozens of miles deep within their interiors, the researchers reported.

In 2020, scientists detected some evidence of recent geological activity on Ariel
(opens in new tab)
, suggesting the possible movement of a potential inner ocean. Miranda also has surface features that look relatively fresh, according to the researchers, but their modeling suggests that if the moon did have a liquid ocean at some point, it is likely frozen by now. 

To find out if these hidden oceans really exist, scientists will have to get creative. Spectrometers that can detect wavelengths of light reflected by ammonia and chlorides could help prove the presence of these chemicals under the crusts. Scientists could also use instruments that can detect electrical currents carried by liquid water to probe beneath these moons' surfaces. New modeling studies on how these moons formed could also help researchers plan what kind of observations they will need to make in the future, Castillo-Rogez said.

""We need to develop new models for different assumptions on the origin of the moons in order to guide planning for future observations,"" she said.

A child in Maine who recently tested positive for measles may be the state's first case of the viral infection since 2019, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reported Friday
(opens in new tab)
 (May 5).

While the case still needs to be confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Maine's public health agencies are assuming the child is infectious and working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed.

The CDC recommends
(opens in new tab)
 that children receive their first dose of the MMR vaccine, which guards against measles, mumps and rubella, between 12 months and 15 months old. Children should get their second dose between 4 and 6 years old. Alternatively, the MMRV vaccine, which also guards against varicella (chickenpox), may be given following the same vaccination schedule.

One dose of either vaccine is roughly 93% protective against measles, and two doses are 97% protective, meaning there's a small chance of infection even after two doses. However, vaccinated individuals tend to have much milder cases of the disease than unvaccinated people do.

The Maine child with a positive measles test had received one dose of a measles vaccine. (Neither the child's age nor any of their symptoms, if they had any, were noted in the DHHS statement.)

""Anyone at these locations during these times should watch for symptoms for 21 days after their exposure,"" the statement reads. ""If you have symptoms, call a health care provider for instructions before going to the office or hospital to help prevent further spread of infection.""

Between Jan. 1 and April 28, 2023, a total of 10 measles cases were reported nationwide, the CDC reported

(Image credit: Vestland County Municipality)

While playing outside her school in Norway, an 8-year-old girl found an unexpected treasure — not a lost ball or a discarded jump rope, but a flint dagger crafted by Stone Age people 3,700 years ago.

The student, identified only as Elise in a statement
(opens in new tab)
 translated from Norwegian, discovered the gray-brown dagger when she was playing in a rocky area by her school in Vestland County. ""I was going to pick up a piece of glass, and then the stone was there,"" she said in the statement. 

Elise showed the stone to her teacher, Karen Drange, who saw that the stone looked ancient. Drange contacted Vestland county council, and archaeologists from the county examined the artifact.

The nearly 5-inch-long (12 centimeters) tool is a rare find, Louise Bjerre Petersen
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist with Vestland county municipality, said in the translated statement. Flint, a hard sedimentary rock, does not naturally occur in Norway, so the dagger may have come from across the North Sea in Denmark, according to the statement.

The nearly 5-inch-long (12 centimeters) flint dagger was likely crafted during the Neolithic period about 3,700 years ago.  (Image credit: Vestland County Municipality)

This type of dagger is often found with sacrificial finds, the archaeologists added. To further investigate the area, the Vestland County Council and Vestland County's University Museum in Bergen, Norway's second-largest city, teamed up to explore the school's grounds. But they didn't find any other evidence dating back to the Stone Age, they said in the statement.

Based on its style, the dagger likely dates to the New Stone Age, or the Neolithic, a time when prehistoric humans shaped stone tools
(opens in new tab)
 and began to rely on domesticated plants and animals, build permanent villages and develop crafts, such as pottery. In Norway, the Stone Age, which includes the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, lasted from 10000 B.C. to 1800 B.C., with a number of hunter-gatherers permanently settling down to farm around 2400 B.C., according to Talk Norway
(opens in new tab)
, an educational website on Norway's history and cultural heritage.

The dagger will be cataloged and used in research at the University Museum. The artifact isn't the only Stone Age discovery to recently get attention in Norway. This past winter, the full-body reconstruction of a Stone Age teenager who lived 8,300 years ago went on display at the Hå Gamle Prestegard museum in southern Norway. The teen boy was likely part of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer group, but the details surrounding his death are a mystery; it appears he died alone leaning against a cave wall, as his remains had no indications of a burial.

Astronomers may have just found the remnants of some of the universe's very first stars. The chemical signatures of these faraway, 13-plus-billion-year-old objects are remarkably different from those of younger stars, like our sun. By studying them, scientists hope to shed light on how stars, galaxies and even basic elements form. 

The research, co-authored by University of Florence astrophysicist Stefania Salvadori

, was published May 3 in The Astrophysical Journal
(opens in new tab)
. 

In the earliest days of the universe, only very simple elements such as hydrogen and helium were available. The first stars ignited from these elements alone. Over time, their white-hot cores gradually cooked simple atoms into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, magnesium and eventually metals. Later generations of stars formed from clouds of gas containing these heavier atoms, and today most of the stars scientists observe are rich in metals like iron. (Our sun is about 98% hydrogen and helium, but contains trace amounts of heavier elements like iron, neon and carbon.)

Nobody has observed the original metal-deficient stars directly; most of them probably fizzled out or exploded long ago. But scientists can still observe some of their dusty remains by setting their sights billions of light years away.

Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), Salvadori and her team peered into three distant clouds of star-forming gas. On their own, these clouds wouldn't tell scientists very much, but incoming light from nearby quasars — extremely bright galactic cores formed by dust falling into a supermassive black hole — helped reveal the cloud's secrets. Based on which wavelengths of light the gas clouds absorbed, the team determined what elements the stellar remains were made of. 

Sure enough, the clouds were extremely poor in iron and other metallic elements, but rich in carbon, oxygen and magnesium — precisely what would have been left over after the first stars ran out of fuel and exploded, according to the researchers. This tracks with other research into the origins of stars, and may help explain the composition of younger stars, including those found in the Milky Way. 

""Our discovery opens new avenues to indirectly study the nature of the first stars, fully complementing studies of stars in our galaxy,"" Salvadori said in a statement

SpaceX's Starship has been grounded by the U.S. government following claims that the rocket's explosive first launch spread plumes of potentially hazardous debris over homes and the habitats of endangered animals.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) — the U.S. civil aviation regulator — has stopped SpaceX from conducting any further launches until it has concluded a ""mishap investigation"" into Starship's April 20 test launch. The massive rocket’s dramatic flight began by punching a crater into the concrete beneath the launchpad and ended when the giant rocket exploded in mid-air around 4 minutes later.

Dust and debris from the test reportedly rained down on residents in Port Isabel, Texas — a town roughly 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the launchpad — and across Boca Chica's beaches, which are nesting grounds for endangered animals, including birds and sea turtles.

, a chapter director for the Sierra Club environmental advocacy group, said that Port Isabel residents reported broken windows in their businesses and ash-like particles covering their homes and schools. 

SpaceX's launchpad was also left with extensive damage that includes charred, twisted metal and shattered concrete. The force from the rocket's engines blew a hole in the launchpad and created a crater beneath it. ""Concrete shot out into the ocean,"" Cortez told CNBC
(opens in new tab)
, creating shrapnel that ""risked hitting the fuel storage tanks which are these silos adjacent to the launch pad."" 

Debris surrounding Starship's launch pad at Boca Chica, Texas. (Image credit: Patrick Fallon/AFP via Getty Images)

Unlike other launch sites for large rockets, SpaceX’s Boca Chica site lacks both a deluge system, which floods pads with shockwave-suppressing water or foam, and a flame trench to safely channel burning exhaust away.

""Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca, but this could turn out to be a mistake,"" SpaceX founder Elon Musk wrote in an October 2020 tweet.

The FAA's mishap investigation is standard practice when rockets go astray. The FAA’s investigation will need to conclude that Starship does not affect public safety before it can launch again. As debris spread far further than anticipated, the FAA's ""anomaly response plan"" has also come into force, meaning SpaceX must complete extra ""environmental mitigations"" before reapplying for its launch license.

Musk wrote on Twitter that SpaceX began work on ""a massive water-cooled, steel plate to go under the launch mount"" three months prior to the launch, but it wasn't ready in time.

""Looks like we can be ready to launch again in 1 to 2 months,"" he added.

Standing at 394 feet (120 meters) tall and propelled by a record-breaking 16.5 million pounds (7.5 million kilograms) of thrust, SpaceX's Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. Able to carry 10 times the payload of SpaceX's current Falcon 9 rockets, Starship was designed to transport crew members, spacecraft, satellites and cargo to locations in the solar system.

After blasting off from its launchpad at Boca Chica, Starship climbed to a maximum altitude of 24 miles (39 km) before problems with as many as eight of the rocket's 33 Raptor 2 engines caused Starship to flip and roll, leading SpaceX to order the rocket to self-destruct.

Despite the rocket's unexpectedly messy takeoff and fiery demise, SpaceX and Musk have hailed the test as a success that enabled engineers to gather essential data for the next launch. On April 16, four days before the test, Musk lowered expectations, warning in a Twitter discussion
(opens in new tab)
 that if any of the rocket's engines went wrong ""it's like having a box of grenades, really big grenades.""

""This is really kind of the sort of first step in a very long journey that will require many, many flights,"" Musk said. ""For those that have followed the history of Falcon 9, and Falcon 1 actually, and our attempts at reusability, I think it might have been close to 20 attempts before we actually recovered a stage. And then it took many more flights before we had reusability that was meaningful, where we didn't have to rebuild the whole rocket.""

"16 days ago","I watched the moon 'take a bite of the sun' in a rare hybrid solar eclipse last week. Here's what I saw from Australia.","From my viewpoint in the Exmouth Gulf of Western Australia, the solar eclipse's totality brought a colossal corona and a dramatic drifting diamond ring.","A ""diamond ring"" heralded the beginning of totality. (Image credit: Dan Charrois)

From the deck of a cruise ship off the coast of Australia, I witnessed a rare ""hybrid-total"" solar eclipse — the first of its kind in a decade.

The celestial show was dazzling, with a colossal corona — or the sun's glowing outer atmosphere — temporarily visible from behind the moon passing in front of it; multiple prominences, or towering loops of plasma extending from the sun; and a dramatic, drifting ""diamond ring"" that could be seen from Australia on Thursday morning (April 20), with a totality that was gone in 60 seconds.

That morning, myself and 2,000 fellow eclipse-chasers — the vast majority of whom were Australians about to witness their first solar eclipse — woke up under completely clear skies and in the still waters of the Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, aboard the Pacific Explorer, operated by P&O Cruises Australia.

As far as solar eclipses go, a hybrid solar eclipse is a momentous one to see. Hybrid solar eclipses are a combination of a total solar eclipse, when the moon completely blocks the sun's light from reaching Earth, causing temporary darkness known as totality, and an annular solar eclipse, when an outer ring of the sun's light is still visible around the moon. 

However, it's impossible to see both from the same spot; the ""hybrid"" nature of this event is a description of the entire path of the eclipse. In the narrow path of totality, where I was waiting on the cruise ship, eclipse-chasers could look forward to the prospect of an extended display of Baily's beads — bright pinpricks of light that peek out around the edge of the moon just before and after totality. 

After a four-day journey of 850 nautical miles (1,575 kilometers) from Fremantle near Perth through largely clear skies, expectations were high. What unfolded was a totality more spectacular than anyone had predicted. 

A crescent sun moments before totality. (Image credit: Dan Charrois)

""First contact"" of the new moon with the sun occurred at 10:04 a.m. AWST (10:04 p.m. EDT), when the new moon appeared to take a bite from the top of the sun, creating a ""smiley face"" crescent. 

At 11:31 a.m. AWST (11:31 p.m. EDT) — the calculated moment of totality — neared, the temperature noticeably dropped and the light took on a sharp, silvery quality only noticeable during a deep, partial solar eclipse.

Some people reclined on sunbeds to watch the spectacle, wearing specialized eclipse glasses to protect their eyes from the sun; others readied telescopes and cameras. As the moonshadow approached at around 14,000 mph (22,500 km/h), the last spots of sunlight streamed through dozens of lunar valleys.

""Baily's beads!"" came the shout, followed by a ""don't look yet!"" The near-perfect match between moon and sun caused a glorious glitter around the lunar limb as the solar corona was soon revealed. It was a huge spread of wispy, white spikes, larger than any seen during an eclipse for a decade or more; the lightshow was likely related to the sun's nearing a period of peak activity, known as the solar maximum, which it's predicted to reach next year.

As a blue twilight swallowed up the Exmouth Gulf, several pink prominences — explosions on the surface of the sun — were also revealed. A yellowy glow became visible around the horizon, just outside the moon's shadow.

As quickly as it began, this short totality drew to an end. A glitter of beads appeared once again on the other side of the moon as it made its way across the sun, but what followed was extra special.

Instead of quickly coalescing into a single bead of light, the beads seemed to merge erratically, dance indecisively and drift deliciously along the limb before forming a ""diamond ring"" that seemed to last as long as 5 seconds.

Totality as seen from the Pacific Explorer lasted just 60 seconds. (Image credit: Jamie Carter)

Totality was over — gone in just 60 seconds — and my fellow passengers erupted into an excited babble to swap impressions of the experience. 

""There haven't been prominences like that since 1991!"" said Michael Zeiler from GreatAmericanEclipse.com
(opens in new tab)
 at his 11th total solar eclipse. That display of solar explosions is one of the advantages of experiencing a total solar eclipse while the sun is so active.

Next year, when the sun reaches solar maximum, a total solar eclipse will be visible in Mexico, the U.S. and Canada on April 8, 2024 — and that will be one not to miss. That upcoming totality will last more than 4 minutes. 

The Pacific Explorer passengers who witnessed Thursday's eclipse have another one to look forward to — in about eight years time. The next hybrid total solar eclipse will be on Nov. 14, 2031 and will be visible from the Pacific Ocean.

"16 days ago","Rosalind Franklin knew DNA was a helix before Watson and Crick, unpublished material reveals","A new paper based on long-lost documents confirms that DNA discoverer Rosalind Franklin should be credited for discovering the double helix.","Scientist Rosalind Franklin discovered the double helix structure of DNA. (Image credit: Henry Grant Collection/Mol via Shutterstock)

In 1962, scientists James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering the double helix structure of DNA. However, it has long been believed that the trio never would've made this significant discovery if they hadn't stolen data from Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist who was the first person to determine that DNA had a helical structure, similar to a spiral staircase.

Now, a previously overlooked letter and never-published news article, both penned in 1953, confirm that Franklin played as big a role in the discovery of DNA structure as the other Nobel winners, though she died before the prize was awarded, making her ineligible. 

Still, she probably freely shared her knowledge with Watson and Crick, rather than having her X-ray images used without her knowledge, as Watson himself implied, according to a new paper published online on April 27 in the journal Nature

""We wanted to set the record straight,"" Nathaniel Comfort
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and co-author of the paper, told Live Science.

Working alongside Matthew Cobb
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of zoology at the University of Manchester in England, Comfort dug into the archives at the University of Cambridge's Churchill College and found an unpublished article for Time magazine by London journalist Joan Bruce, who wrote the draft in consultation with Franklin.

In the article, Bruce wrote that the group of scientists had divided themselves into teams, one consisting of Wilkins and Franklin, who focused on X-ray analysis of DNA, and the other of Watson and Crick, who were working to solve DNA's structure through a model-based approach. (In 1953, Watson and Crick published a paper in Nature on DNA's structure
(opens in new tab)
 that was based on both X-rays and models.) 

Related: Mysterious protein makes human DNA morph into different shapes

While they often worked independently, they also ""linked up, confirming each other's work from time to time, or wrestling over a common problem,"" Bruce wrote. Given this dynamic, Franklin likely freely shared her knowledge of DNA's spiral structure with Watson and Crick, the Nature paper suggests. 

The second piece of evidence was a letter written by Pauline Cowan, one of Franklin's colleagues. In the letter, Cowan invited Crick to a speech given by Franklin about how DNA can take on different forms.

""This was the biggest surprise for us since it showed that there wasn't this dramatic race like you see in modern competitive labs,"" Cobb said.

Cobb and Comfort concluded that Franklin was relaxed in knowing that Crick and Watson knew about her research, writing in their Nature paper that Franklin was ""an equal contributor to solving [DNA's structure]."" 

So, what caused the true story behind the discovery of DNA to become so muddled?

That's all thanks to Photograph 51, an X-ray taken by Franklin in 1952 that depicted a strand of DNA from human tissue.

In his 1968 book ""The Double Helix,"" Watson alleged that he saw Franklin's photograph without her knowing and upon first glance he was able to spot DNA's double-helix structure, making it appear that Franklin lacked the knowledge to decipher the image on her own, according to the paper. 

In reality, ""she knew it was a helix,"" Cobb said. For instance, in notes from a seminar she gave in 1951, she described both forms of DNA as a ""big helix with several chains,"" according to the new study. (In solution, DNA can take on a crystalline ""A"" form or a paracrystalline ""B"" form.)

""[Our research] presents a better picture of Franklin,"" Comfort said. ""Before, she was reduced from being a scientist to a tragic heroine and had no agency in the story. We wanted to reinstate her as a fully fleshed scientist.""

Still, if her image led Watson to realize DNA was a double helix, then Watson and Crick committed a faux-pas when they didn't cite Franklin in their landmark paper. (It is standard scientific practice to include researchers whose work informs yours in the reference section of a paper.)

However, in a followup paper published in 1954, perhaps in an attempt to right their wrong, they did offer Franklin credit by stating that it would've been ""impossible"" to discover DNA's structure without her data, according to the Nature paper.

Polar bear twins have been reunited in a zoo after more than two years apart. The siblings were separated shortly after birth when one of them developed severe health problems and was later rejected by their mother.

The female polar bears (Ursus maritimus), named Astra and Laerke, were born at Detroit Zoo on Nov. 17, 2020 to mother Suka and father Nuka. But two days later, Laerke was separated from the den she shared with her mother and sister due to a medical emergency, which required keepers to hand-feed her and monitor her around the clock. After making a full recovery, zoo staff attempted to slowly reintegrate Laerke with Suka and Astra — but it did not go to plan. 

""Suka was very protective of her cub, Astra, and acted aggressively toward the cub she no longer recognized as her own,"" Detroit Zoo representatives told Live Science in an email. Laerke remained in a separate enclosure during the reintegration process and ""was never at risk of being injured"" by the mother, they added.

Astra and Suka were moved into separate enclosures in January this year after Astra reached the age when polar bears leave their mothers in the wild. This gave zoo staff the opportunity to reunite Astra with her twin, who grew up alongside an abandoned grizzly bear named Jebbie.

After a brief period of reintegration, where the pair met and interacted with one another in adjoining cages, zoo keepers let Laerke into Astra's new enclosure on April 11. The reintroduction went extremely well and ""the sisters appear to enjoy sharing a space,"" the zoo representatives said. They hope the pair can remain together full-time, the representatives added. 

On April 17, the zoo shared heartwarming images of Astra and Laerke playing together on Facebook
(opens in new tab)
 along with the caption ""sister, sister — never knew how much I missed ya.""

Keepers will continue to closely monitor the pair in the coming weeks. They expect that after becoming familiar with one another, the twins may spend less time together, which is normal because adult polar bears tend to keep to themselves in the wild.

Laerke's story is quite a common one in zoos. 

On Feb. 27, Born Free — a U.K.-based charity that advocates for relocating captive animals to the wild, as well as improving their quality of life — released a report
(opens in new tab)
 into the issues associated with keeping polar bears in captivity. Along with concerns about reduced lifespans, improper diets and a lack of space to roam, the report said captive cubs are more likely to die or develop health complications in captivity, with less than half surviving past 30 days.

When humans step in to save them, mothers can end up rejecting their babies. This is likely because mothers are more stressed when giving birth in captivity than in the wild, according to the report.

However, Polar Bears International
(opens in new tab)
, a non-profit conservation organization, says zoos and aquariums also play an important role in conserving polar bears. 

Captivity will also play an important role in preserving the species for future generations to appreciate because climate change is expected to wipe out most wild populations, potentially as early as the end of this century.

(Image credit: Hong Kong Baptist University (screenshot from hongkongbaptistu on YouTube))

Scientists in Hong Kong have discovered tiny, cube-shaped box jellyfish in a brackish shrimp pond that are completely unknown to science.

The diminutive jellies have a completely transparent and colorless body, or bell, as well as 12 tentacles ending in small, paddle-like structures that enable the critters to speed through water faster than most other jellyfish species. 

Like other box jellies — a group of Cnidarians that includes the Australian box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri), the world’s most venomous marine animal, according to the National Ocean Service
(opens in new tab)
 — the newly described jellies have 24 eyes arranged in clusters of six around its cubic bell.

""This box jellyfish connects the base of its tentacles and its bell with a flat base that looks like a boat paddle, making it distinct from other common jellyfish,"" Qiu Jianwen
(opens in new tab)
, a professor in the Department of Biology at Hong Kong Baptist University who led the research, said in a video
(opens in new tab)
. ""Another feature of the box jellyfish is that it has six eyes located on each side of its body."" 

Researchers named the newfound species Tripedalia maipoensis after Mai Po Nature Reserve
(opens in new tab)
 in Hong Kong, where they found it. They describe its features and relationship to other box jellies in a study published March 20 in the journal Zoological Studies
(opens in new tab)
.

Related: Alien-like giant phantom jellyfish spotted in frigid waters off Antarctica 

T. maipoensis is the first-ever box jelly to be found in Chinese waters. It is unclear whether the half-inch-long (1.5 centimeters) animal can sting humans, but it may be venomous enough to stun tiny shrimp called Artemia. ""It seemed to paralyze Artemia offered in the lab,"" Qiu told Live Science in an email. ""But we did not touch the animal to feel the sting.""

The researchers first noticed the unusual creatures in samples collected from an intertidal shrimp pond, known as a ""gei wai"" locally, during the summers of 2020 to 2022. The jellyfish were ""quite abundant,"" Qiu told Live Science, numbering ""up to 400 individuals in an area of the pond."" A tidal channel from the brackish pool means that the species could also be present in the adjacent waters of the Pearl River estuary, but no work has been done yet to confirm this, the researchers wrote in the study.

Box jellyfish, which are also known as sea wasps, move by allowing water to enter canals that run along a muscular membrane on the underside of their bodies and then expelling it. The researchers found that, unlike closely related species, T. maipoensis has forked canals separating into multiple branches. The newly discovered species is the third known member of a group of box jellies characterized by tentacles ending in flat, paddle-like structures, called Tripedalia.

The scientists also noted that each cluster of six eyes on the jellies' cubic bell includes a pair of eyes with lenses that enable image-forming, as well as four eyes that can only sense light.

The species probably feeds on small crustaceans called copepods, which were abundant in the samples taken from the shrimp pond, Qiu told Live Science.

""We are thrilled with this discovery,"" Qiu said in the video. ""Finding a new species in Mai Po, where extensive research has been conducted, highlights the potential for more marine life discovery in the Hong Kong and even the Chinese coastal waters.""

"16 days ago","'Mind-control' parasite Toxoplasma hides from the immune system with 2 key genes","A single-cell parasite relies on two genes that boost each other's activity to switch into ""defense mode"" when attacked by the immune system.","A new study could help scientists find a cure to lifelong infections caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii.  (Image credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)

The parasite Toxoplasma gondii hides in up to half of humans
(opens in new tab)
, although it rarely causes symptoms. But when it infects mice, the single-cell organism can exert a kind of ""mind control"" to change the rodents' behavior and help itself spread. 

Now, researchers report being one step closer to curing T. gondii infections in humans, which can be lifelong due to the parasite's ability to morph into a dormant, defensive state. Two transcription factors — proteins that switch genes ""on"" and ""off"" — lie at the root of this metamorphosis, and the discovery opens avenues to block the process.

Often dubbed the ""mind-control parasite,"" T. gondii takes over the minds
(opens in new tab)
 of infected mice and steers them towards cats to become their next meal. This enables the parasites to jump into our feline friends, the only known hosts
(opens in new tab)
 in which they can reproduce sexually.

Scientists remain unsure whether the parasite can similarly control the human brain; some studies suggest it could contribute to aggression, impulsive behavior
(opens in new tab)
 and schizophrenia
(opens in new tab)
, while other studies
(opens in new tab)
 dispute these effects. Most people carrying T. gondii don't develop any symptoms, but more rarely, the infection can trigger mild, flu-like symptoms or even severe illness. Developing fetuses, newborns, and people with weak immune systems are most vulnerable to severe toxoplasmosis, which can damage the eyes and brain and sometimes be fatal.

Related: Can a cat parasite control your mind?

The parasite proliferates rapidly in its ""tachyzoite
(opens in new tab)
"" form. But under stressful conditions like an immune attack, T. gondii burrows into brain and muscle tissue and morphs into a ""bradyzoite,"" which encloses itself inside a cyst and waits to revert to its active state. Immune cells and current treatments can clear away tachyzoites, but the cysts protect the bradyzoites
(opens in new tab)
 from attack.

Parasitologist Sebastian Lourido
(opens in new tab)
 and his colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) previously discovered
(opens in new tab)
 a protein that switches ""on"" genes essential for turning tachyzoites into bradyzoites, which they named Bradyzoite-Formation Deficient 1 (BFD1). However, the regulation of BFD1 remains poorly understood. 

In the new study published April 20 in the journal Nature Microbiology
(opens in new tab)
, the team discovered another transcription factor that regulates BFD1, which they named BFD2. 

The study ""mechanistically added a lot"" to the initial story, said Mohamed-Ali Hakimi
(opens in new tab)
, a parasitologist at Grenoble Alpes University in France who was not involved with the work. 

When the researchers deleted the gene that codes for BFD2, they found that tachyzoites could not switch into bradyzoites and form cysts. The scientists injected 100 copies of the parasite without the gene into mice and didn't detect cysts in brain autopsies performed 45 days later. This couldn't be explained by the immune system successfully clearing away the parasite because low levels of tachyzoites were still detected.

Next, the team determined that BFD1 and BFD2 regulate each other. Stress boosted both BFD1 and BFD2 in mice, but deleting the BFD1-coding gene also silenced the gene for BFD2. The researchers determined that BFD1 binds to the BFD2-coding gene and switches it ""on."" 

BFD2 regulates BFD1 differently, however. When the gene for BFD2 was deleted, the BFD1-coding gene remained ""on,"" and its genetic instructions were copied down into mRNA molecules, which are needed to synthesize the BFD1 protein. However, no protein was produced. 

The team determined that T. gondii cells maintain a supply of this mRNA, but they can only make the BFD1 protein when BFD2 binds to the mRNA and thus triggers protein synthesis. This binding only happens when the cell is under stress. 

By perpetuating each other's activity, the two transcription factors can commit tachyzoites to morphing into bradyzoites by ""locking the cell into this developmental trajectory,"" said M. Haley Licon
(opens in new tab)
, parasitologist and lead author of the study. Future research could unravel what factors switch ""off"" this self-perpetuating loop, she added, enabling bradyzoites to revert to tachyzoites when stressful conditions elapse.

""We still don't know what the signals that control differentiation are,"" Lourido told Live Science in an email. Unraveling those signals may be key to halting bradyzoite formation, he added.

""Current therapies against Toxoplasma cannot cure the infection because the chronic stages are resistant,"" Lourido explained. He added that inhibiting differentiation could render the parasite ""susceptible to existing drugs,"" which could cure the infection. 

Hakimi argued that scientists are a long way from developing such drugs. ""It's very hard to target transcription factors,"" and aside from select drugs used in cancer treatment
(opens in new tab)
, ""very few drugs"" do, he said. 

Licon agreed but is optimistic that ""understanding the circuit and regulation thereof"" could reveal ways to block the parasite from entering its protected, dormant state.

The Celestron NexStar 8SE Telescope is our top-rated telescope, and it's reduced at Amazon.

When looking for the best telescope deals, it never hurts to aim high and consider checking out some of the best telescopes around. Naturally, these often come with sizeable price tags, and that can certainly be said of the Celestron NexStar 8SE Telescope.

Even better, you can save on that hefty $1599 MSRP, with Amazon offering $200 off Celestron NexStar 8SE
(opens in new tab)
 right now. That brings the price down to just $1399. 

Update 25/4: The price had briefly dropped even further to $1250, but it looks like it's back at $1399. Still a fantastic deal.

VIEW DEAL

That's still a high price, we'll admit, but we still find ourselves recommending the Celestron NexStar 8SE thanks to its computerized nature and standout design.

There are few telescopes as eye-catching, but it's what you can see through it that'll really take your breath away, with the 8-inch aperture allowing for gorgeous views in a small body.

Images are crisp, and the mount features a database of more than 40,000 celestial objects, meaning you're guaranteed your very own tour of the cosmos.

The Celestron NexStar 8SE is easy to assemble and put away, too, and takes just minutes to align. There's a two year warranty, too.

In our Celestron NexStar 8SE review, we awarded it 4-and-a-half stars, praising its sharp views, sturdiness, and range of functions. We said:

""Beginner astronomers could go their whole lives without swapping out this telescope for another, and intermediate or advanced astronomers will benefit from the go-to motorized function and scalability with additional accessories. Though, casual astronomers with tighter budgets may want to look for something cheaper.""

Archaeologists have discovered the foundations of a ""lost"" second-century Roman fort in western Scotland — part of an ill-fated effort to extend the empire's control throughout Britain.

The fort was one of up to 41 defensive structures built along the Antonine Wall — a fortification of mainly earthworks and wood that ran for about 40 miles (65 kilometers) across Scotland at its narrowest point, according to Historic Environment Scotland
(opens in new tab)
 (HES), a government agency.

The Roman emperor Antoninus Pius ordered the wall built in A.D. 142 in hopes of surpassing his predecessor Hadrian, who about 20 years earlier had built the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall about 100 miles (160 km) to the south.

But his push was ultimately unsuccessful, in part because of the hostility of the Indigenous people. (At this time the Romans called them ""Caledonians""; later they would call them ""Picts,"" from a Latin word meaning ""painted people,"" because of their body paintings or tattoos.) After 20 years trying to hold their new northern line, the Romans abandoned the Antonine Wall in A.D. 162 and retreated back to Hadrian's Wall.

""Antoninus Pius was effectively a bureaucrat,"" historian and archaeologist John Reid
(opens in new tab)
 told Live Science. ""He had no military experience, and we think he was looking for a win that he could pretty much guarantee against the exotic Caledonian people.""

Reid explained that Roman emperors needed to claim a military victory, and so Antoninus Pius used his conquest of Scotland — while it lasted — to justify his rule.

Reid, who was not involved in the new discovery, is author of the book ""The Eagle and the Bear: A New History of Roman Scotland""
(opens in new tab)
 (Birlinn, 2023) and chairman of the Trimontium Trust
(opens in new tab)
, which investigates Roman archaeology in the Scottish Borders region.

""Lost"" fort

Archaeologists from HES found the buried remains of the small fort, or ""fortlet,"" beside a school on the northwestern outskirts of the modern city of Glasgow.

The structure was mentioned by an antiquarian in 1707, but it had never been found since, despite efforts to locate it in the 1970s and 1980s.

The fort consisted of two small wooden buildings surrounded by a rampart of stone and turf up to 6.5 feet (2 meters) high, built along the south side of the Antonine Wall. The rampart had two wooden towers above gates on opposite sides — one at the north to let people, animals and wagons through the wall and one at the south.

None of the Roman forts along the Antonine Wall are now visible, although excavations have revealed evidence and its defensive ditch can still be seen in some places.  (Image credit: Historic Environment Scotland)

But there's now nothing above ground to show that the fort was ever there; , and the archaeologists located its buried stone foundations using gradiometry, a noninvasive geophysical technique that measures tiny variations in Earth's magnetic field to detect underground structures. 

About 12 soldiers — many of them local auxiliaries, or ""auxilia,"" who had signed on to fight for the Romans — would have been stationed at the fort for about a week at a time to keep watch over the area and prevent raids on the fortifications.

They'd then be relieved by a new detachment of soldiers from a larger Roman fort at Duntocher, about a mile (1.6 km) to the east, according to the HES statement.

The fort is mentioned in writings from 1707, but it hadn't been seen since. No sign of it now remains above the ground. (Image credit: Historic Environment Scotland)

There's now little visible evidence of the Antonine Wall, and the newly discovered fortlet is a rare find.

Reid said it helped confirm a theory that the Romans first hoped to duplicate Hadrian's Wall, with stronger and higher fortifications made of stone and a small fort, or ""milecastle,"" every mile of its length. ""But then they thought better of it and decided they needed proper-sized forts,"" he said. 

Roman fortifications in the Tayside region, north of the Antonine Wall, showed that the Romans planned to subjugate all of Scotland, but the Antonine Wall and any northern possessions seem to have been abandoned after A.D. 162, he said. 

Thereafter, Hadrian's Wall became the northernmost frontier of the empire, seemingly until Roman rule collapsed in Britain in the early fifth century, he said.

Reid's Trimontium Trust has conducted excavations at Burnswark Hill, the site of a Caledonian hillfort and a fortified Roman military camp built to attack it after Antoninus Pius ordered his legions to conquer Scotland north of Hadrian's Wall. Among the finds there were whistling sling bullets that the Romans may have used as ""terror weapons"" against the defenders.

The reason for the Roman eventual withdrawal from the Antonine Wall and back to Hadrian's Wall is not well understood. 

""There's lots of debate,"" Reid said. ""Was it because the Romans got fed up? Was it because the Romans had trouble elsewhere? Was it because it was too costly to run two frontiers? Was it because Antonius Pius died [in A.D. 161]? Nobody's really sure; I suspect it was a combination of all of those.""

After more than a year together on the Red Planet, NASA's Perseverance rover and its hitchhiking ""pet rock"" have finally parted ways. The stone had been lodged in one of the rover's wheels for more than half of its mission on Mars.

Perseverance accidentally picked up the pet rock in its front left wheel on Feb. 4, 2022 or Sol 341 — the 341st Martian day of the mission. The rock posed no danger to the rover's scientific mission but did manage to periodically photobomb images and cling on despite several vigorous maneuvers across the planet's surface. Mission scientists previously likened the situation to ""having a pebble stuck in your shoe.""

On April 18 (Sol 768), NASA released an image
(opens in new tab)
 of the rover's front left wheel showing the rock had been dislodged. In total, the rock remained in the rover's wheel for around 439 days (427 Sols) — around 55% of the time Perseverance has spent on Mars since landing there on Feb 18, 2021. During that time, the pair traveled around 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) together. (A sol, or Martian day, is 37 minutes longer than an Earth day.)

During its mission, Perseverance has picked up several other smaller rocks in its other wheels. But these all fell out within a couple of days or weeks of getting stuck, and posed no threat to the wandering robot. However, rocks lodged in other places have previously caused problems for the rover.

A bunch of small pebbles fell into part of Perseverance's inner machinery in December 2021, causing the rover to shut down for almost a week before mission scientists could figure out a way to safely remove them.

Hitchhiking rocks have also caused issues on other Mars rovers. Operators of NASA's Spirit rover — which roamed the Red Planet between January 2004 and March 2010 — had to perform a sharp turn to shake out a ""potato-sized"" stone from its right-rear wheel in December 2004. Mission scientists, performed this maneuver because they feared it would cause significant damage to the rover, according to NASA

(Image credit: dottedhippo/Getty Images)

Tully monsters haunted Earth's oceans 300 million years ago and left behind such bizarre fossils that researchers haven't even agreed on whether these strange creatures had backbones. Now, more than 60 years after the strange creature's discovery in 1958, a new investigation using 3D lasers finds that the Tully monster was likely an invertebrate, but not everyone is convinced. 

This alien-looking evolutionary oddball ​​— only found in the Mazon Creek fossil beds in Illinois — had a soft body, eyes on stalks, and a claw-like appendage coming out of its face. Other aspects of its anatomy, however, are open to interpretation.

The latest research, published April 16 in the journal Palaeontology
(opens in new tab)
, is one of a slew of studies attempting to classify the creature.

Most recent Tully monster (Tullimonstrum gregarium) studies argue that it's either a vertebrate relative of modern cyclostomes (including lampreys and hagfish) in the chordate group or an unknown invertebrate. Now, researchers in Japan think they've cracked the case, with the help of a 3D laser scanner.

""We believe that the mystery of it being an invertebrate or vertebrate has been solved,"" first author Tomoyuki Mikami
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral student at the University of Tokyo and a researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo, said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""Based on multiple lines of evidence, the vertebrate hypothesis of the Tully monster is untenable.""

Related: Ancient 'Tully monster' was a vertebrate, not a spineless blob, study claims 

The researchers scanned more than 150 Tully monster fossils to create color-coded 3D maps of the animal's anatomical structures. They also X-rayed one well-preserved proboscis — the claw-like appendage — to examine the creature's teeth.

The results suggested that features previously used to argue Tully monsters are near cyclostomes taxonomically, including their teeth and gill pouches, were misinterpreted. The teeth analyzed in the new study had bulging bases — unlike cyclostome teeth, which are thinner at the base. The authors said what appeared to be gills was actually just segmentation in the body.

Most convincing of all, the team claims, is segmentation found on the creature's head. ""This characteristic is not known in any vertebrate lineage, suggesting a nonvertebrate affinity,"" Mikami said. 

Victoria McCoy
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, is not convinced, however. McCoy led a 2016 study placing Tully monsters near cyclosomes and a 2020 study that found Tully monster tissues were made up of proteins
(opens in new tab)
 like those of vertebrates — and not chitin, like those of invertebrates.  

""It didn't change my mind about what the Tully monster was,"" McCoy told Live Science. ""But it is new information, and that definitely advances our understanding."" 

McCoy was excited by the researchers' application of 3D imaging but had ""minor technical quibbles with some of their conclusions."" She argued that cyclostomes are very diverse in the fossil record and thus some species could have had the bulging-based teeth documented in the study. She also noted that the anatomy of animals preserved in Mazon Creek separates and shifts, which could account for the appearance of segmentation.

—Oops, this 300 million-year-old 'blob' fossil was upside down. It's not a jellyfish after all.

—Oldest 'fish-lizard' fossils ever found suggest these sea monsters survived the 'Great Dying'

""The real-life morphology gets changed a lot during fossilization,"" McCoy said. ""If you have a thousand specimens, any one feature might be preserved a hundred different ways.""

Deciding where the Tully monster belongs is significant because the species is so unusual that it will expand the diversity of whatever group it ends up in, changing the way we think about that group.

The latest study also puts forward a potential compromise for the discrepancies: that Tully monsters could possibly be nonvertebrate chordates like modern tunicates or lancelets. For now, however, the Tully monster's place on the evolutionary tree remains unclear.

VIEW DEAL

One of the best features of the OLYMPUS OM-D E-M1 Mark III is its Starry Sky Autofocus, which means the camera is able to use an algorithm to zero in on the smallest stars visible for an impressively sharp picture.

There are two priority modes, too; one for accuracy, and one for speed. The former is ideal for tripods, but the latter means you can grab some great astrophotography shots with a handheld camera. Don't worry about your arm getting tired, either - the OLYMPUS OM-D E-M1 Mark III is impressively compact and lightweight.

That small size does mean the sensor is a little smaller, but with the wealth of features on offer we'd say it's still worth a look.

There's even a Live Composite mode that keeps the shutter open for six hours, adding exposure when lighting changes, and USB connectivity is ideal for keeping the battery topped up while out and about.

You will need your own lenses, however, as this deal is for the camera body only.

"17 days ago","Does it matter what time of day you get cancer treatment?","The emerging field of ""cancer chronotherapy"" hints that it may be best to receive cancer treatment at a particular time of day.","Research hints that it may be best to get cancer treatments, like chemotherapy, at specific times of day. (Image credit: FatCamera via Getty Images)

The trillions of cells in the human body run to the rhythm of an ever-ticking clock. This internal timepiece is known as the circadian rhythm, where ""circadian"" stems from the Latin words ""circa diem,"" meaning ""around a day."" In roughly 24-hour cycles, the functions of the body's tissues fluctuate, and throughout the day and night, these oscillations in activity affect everything from blood pressure levels and hormone production to immune cell activity and energy metabolism. 

Evidence suggests that cancer also tunes its activity to the circadian rhythm and that our internal clock influences how the body breaks down and reacts to drugs. These observations raise an important question: Does it matter what time of day you get cancer treatment? For instance, is there an optimal time to get chemotherapy when the treatment would be the safest and most effective?

The short answer is yes, probably. However, the field of ""cancer chronotherapy"" — aimed at figuring out how to optimally sync cancer treatment to the circadian rhythm — is still in its early days.

""I think it has huge potential, honestly,"" Katja Lamia
(opens in new tab)
, an associate professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in California, said of cancer chronotherapy. ""I think that people don't really appreciate how much of a difference it can make, what time certain drugs are given."" 

Related: Why do some forms of leukemia affect mostly children? 

Past research by Lamia's lab demonstrated that the rate at which the liver processes metformin
(opens in new tab)
, a widely used type 2 diabetes drug, varies in time with the circadian rhythm in mice. A different study involving mice and human cells suggested that circadian clocks may broadly regulate how quickly the body breaks down drugs by helping control which drug metabolism-related genes
(opens in new tab)
 are switched ""on"" or ""off"" at a given time. This affects how quickly mice metabolize ketamine, and thus how long the rodents stay asleep when given the anesthetic, the team found.

In the realm of cancer, Lamia's lab is currently investigating
(opens in new tab)
 why circadian rhythm disruptions — such as those seen in night-shift workers — have been linked to an increased risk of cancer in observational studies. This risk may be related to the circadian rhythm's role in regulating the rate at which cells detect and repair damage in their DNA, the team suspects.

Several lines of evidence support the idea that circadian rhythm disruptions raise the risk of cancer, but the exact mechanisms driving this link still need to be uncovered, and they may vary among cancer types, according to a review published in March 2023 in the journal Trends in Cell Biology
(opens in new tab)
. 

In addition, other research suggests that, once cancer is present in the body, its ability to metastasize, or spread, appears to fluctuate in daily cycles and may be regulated by the circadian rhythm. For example, breast cancer may be more likely to metastasize at night, while prostate cancer and multiple myeloma (a cancer of the white blood cells) may be most likely to spread during the day, according to a statement
(opens in new tab)
.

Since the 1980s, various research groups have conducted human studies of timed cancer therapies, aimed at finding the sweet spot where the patient experiences as few side effects as possible but gets the maximum benefit from their treatment.

According to the Trends in Cell Biology review, several studies of timed chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer have shown success. Patients given an infusion of one chemotherapy drug during the day and another at night experienced fewer side effects and slightly increased survival times, compared with patients on a standard dosing schedule. Similarly, decreases in side effects were seen in ovarian cancer patients in a comparable trial, and improvements in survival time have been seen in trials with patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow) or glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer). 

Notably, not all studies of timed chemotherapy have had positive results. For example, ""some studies in patients with colorectal and ovarian cancer do not support previous research,"" the review noted.

There have also been timed trials of immunotherapy, which works by lowering the invisibility cloak that cancer uses to hide from the immune system while also revving up the body's immune response. 

In one study, melanoma patients received immunotherapy
(opens in new tab)
 infusions either before 4:30 p.m. or after, and those in the earlier group had a ""nearly doubled"" overall survival times compared with the latter group. In a different trial involving non-small-cell lung cancer patients
(opens in new tab)
, those given immunotherapy before 12:45 p.m. ""had quadrupled median progression-free and overall survival"" times compared to those treated later in the day. These results are particularly interesting because immunotherapies hang around in the body for some time, so it's not entirely understood why the timing of administration seems to matter, the review authors noted. 

Although these trials hint at the promise of cancer chronotherapy, much more research is needed before cancer doctors and researchers will be fully convinced of the concept, Lamia told Live Science. ""We haven't gotten to where chemotherapy cancer experts are totally convinced,"" she said. ""I think it's going to take a large clinical trial, which hasn't really been done yet.""

—What is brain fog?

—How long can you go without sleep? 

The review authors wrote that, ""although the idea of chronotherapy has brought much excitement, it is still viewed with caution owing to its historical partial success rate."" To ""fully unleash its potential on the clinical side,"" scientists will need to better understand how the circadian rhythm influences cancer progression, at a genetic and cellular level. For instance, researchers need to better understand how the internal clock controls the proliferation and release of metastasis-driving tumor cells into the bloodstream.

Lamia noted that more research is also needed to understand how a person's sex influences their optimal timing for cancer treatment, as some studies indicate that a person's sex may be a key factor to consider
(opens in new tab)
. There's also a broader question of how conditions in hospitals, which tend to be unfavorable for sleep, affect a patient's circadian rhythm and their cancer prognosis, she added.

In short, ""we're still in early days"" for cancer chronotherapy, Lamia said. Scientists have yet to uncover all the nuances of how the effects of different cancer drugs, designed to target distinct tumor types, might vary depending on the time of day they're given to patients. 

""I think the potential impact of this area is really high,"" Lamia told Live Science. ""But it's so complicated that it's going to take a lot of work to get to where we can really implement changes.""

"17 days ago","Scientists find weird holes on the ocean floor spewing ancient fluids 'like a fire hose'","Understanding the movement of fluids in the Cascadia subduction zone can help researchers pinpoint the risk of earthquakes","Fluid spewing from the seafloor off the coast of Oregon comes from the Cascadia subduction zone. (Image credit: University of Washington)

Holes spewing warm fluids from the boundary between tectonic plates have been discovered at the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Oregon. Researchers think this strange, never-before-seen phenomenon, dubbed Pythia's Oasis after an ancient Greek priestess, could provide insight into earthquake risk along the dangerous fault — although exactly how it affects the tectonics is unclear. 

The Cascadia subduction zone stretches from Vancouver Island to northern California. It is the offshore region where the Explorer, Juan de Fuca, and Gorda oceanic plates slide under the North American continental plate. The plate boundary has the capacity to produce earthquakes of magnitude 9 or more — among the most powerful quakes produced on Earth — according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management
(opens in new tab)
. A devastating quake could also be accompanied by tsunami waves up to 100 feet (30.5 meters) high. 

Now, research published Jan. 25 in the journal Science Advances
(opens in new tab)
 finds that off the coast of Newport, Oregon, on the seafloor 3,412 feet (1,040 m) below the ocean surface, there is a series of at least four small vents bubbling fluids from deep within the fault.

(Image credit: Philip, B., Science Advances, 2023 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.add6688)

These vents, each of which measures about 2 inches (5 centimeters) across, are about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the shore. The geochemistry of these fluids reveals that they originate from about 2.5 miles (4 km) deep, near where the plates meet. 

The escape of these fluids could influence how the plates interact, which could ultimately influence how and when earthquakes occur in the region. 

""It's potentially changing the stresses and the pressure of fluids at greater depth,"" Demian Saffer, director of the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, who was not involved in the research, told Live Science. ""That becomes interesting, because those are the depths where we think about earthquakes possibly occurring.""

Saffer said there is no simple correlation between fluid flow and earthquakes and thus more work will be needed to understand if or how these fluids affect earthquake risk in the Pacific Northwest. 

The vents were first spotted by then-University of Washington graduate student Brendan Philip, now a White House policy adviser, during a research cruise. The ship's sonar detected bubbles rising from the seafloor, study co-author Evan Solomon, an associate professor of oceanography at the University of Washington, said in a statement. 

""They explored in that direction and what they saw was not just methane bubbles, but water coming out of the seafloor like a firehose,"" Solomon said. ""That's something that I've never seen, and to my knowledge has not been observed before.""

The fluids were 16 degrees Fahrenheit (9 degrees Celsius) warmer than the surrounding seawater, indicating they originate from deep, hot portions of the crust, and rich in minerals such as boron and lithium. The fluids are coming from crust that was last on the surface 2 million years ago, Saffer said.

""We can't sample the rock, but we're getting the fluids that are touching those rocks,"" he said.

How this fluid affects the behavior of the fault is an open question, Saffer said. 

""There are some arguments … where we think that highly pressurized fluids might play a role in suppressing earthquake behavior and instead promote slower kinds of failure, like slow-slip events or even stable aseismic creep,"" he said. Slow-slip events are gradual plate movements that release energy without causing shaking, while aseismic creep is the movement of faults past one another without friction or earthquake hazard. There are still too many unknowns about the plumbing underlying the newly discovered vents to say for sure what effect the flow might have.

""It's somehow draining or partly draining the fault,"" Saffer said. ""What we don’t know is over how big an area that's happening, and we also don't know how much that's changing the pressure and stress on the fault. … Those are the kinds of things that would be natural next steps to try to figure out.""

"18 days ago","Black patients may need breast cancer screenings earlier than what many guidelines recommend","A study suggests that Black patients might benefit from breast cancer screenings starting at age 42, rather than age 50.","A study suggests that it may be beneficial for Black women to start getting regular breast cancer screenings earlier than is generally recommended. (Image credit: BENOIT DOPPAGNE / Contributor via Getty Images)

In line with many current medical guidelines
(opens in new tab)
, doctors generally recommend that their female patients be regularly screened for breast cancer with mammograms starting at age 50. However, for Black patients, it may be better to start screening years earlier, because their risk of breast cancer death in their 40s is higher than that seen in other racial groups, a new study suggests.

""The current one-size-fits-all policy to screen the entire female population from a certain age may be neither fair and equitable nor optimal,"" wrote the authors of the new study, published Wednesday (April 19) in the journal JAMA Network Open
(opens in new tab)
. ""Clinical trials may be warranted to investigate whether changing screening guidelines may alter the trajectory of the disease and have a population impact,"" particularly among Black female patients, they wrote.

The study authors analyzed data on breast cancer deaths that occurred in the U.S. between 2011 and 2020; in this time frame, more than 415,200 breast cancer deaths were reported. The data were drawn from the National Center for Health Statistics, which keeps records on more than 99% of U.S. deaths.

Among patients in their 40s, the rate of breast cancer deaths varied significantly by race and ethnicity, the authors found. The rate among Black patients in this age group was 27 deaths per 100,000 people per year. (In epidemiology, this rate can also be written as per 100,000 ""person-years."") 

That's compared with 15 deaths per 100,000 person-years in white patients and 11 deaths per 100,000 person-years in American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander patients, respectively.

Related: Hormonal birth control slightly increases breast cancer risk, regardless of type

Overall, across all of the racial and ethnic groups, the average risk of dying from breast cancer between the ages of 50 and 59 was about 0.329%, the researchers calculated. 

""However, this risk level is reached at different ages for women from different racial/ethnic groups,"" Dr. Mahdi Fallah
(opens in new tab)
, a co-author of the new study and leader of the Risk Adapted Cancer Prevention Group at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany, told CNN in an email
(opens in new tab)
. 

""Black women tend to reach this risk level of 0.329% earlier, at age 42. White women tend to reach it at age 51, American Indian or Alaska Native and Hispanic women at age 57 years, and Asian or Pacific Islander women later, at age 61,"" Fallah said. Although patients of American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander heritage had similar death rates due to breast cancer in their 40s, the team found that they still crossed this threshold of risk at different ages.   

RELATED STORIES

—More women reported to have rare cancer linked to breast implants 

The authors concluded that their ""findings suggest that health policy makers and clinicians could consider an alternative, race and ethnicity-adapted approach in which Black female patients start screening earlier,"" around 42 years old instead of 50.

The authors also noted that, while some groups of medical experts recommend starting breast cancer screening at age 50, others say patients should consider earlier start times.

For example, the American Cancer Society currently recommends
(opens in new tab)
 that women at average risk for breast cancer begin screenings at age 45 but have the option to start as young as 40. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends
(opens in new tab)
 that patients be offered screenings as early as 40 and begin screenings no later than 50. 

However, many others guidelines recommend starting screenings at age 50 and frame starting younger than that as an individual decision. 

The age at which patients start screenings is likely not the only factor that could explain why Black patients see high rates of breast cancer deaths in their 40s, the study authors emphasized. However, they propose that shifting screenings earlier for Black patients could be a way to begin addressing the problem.

Dr. Rachel Freedman
(opens in new tab)
, a breast oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who was not involved in the new study, said it's hard to say from this study whether earlier screenings would make the difference. 

""This study confirms that the age of breast cancer-mortality is younger for Black women, but it doesn't confirm why and if screening is even the main reason,"" Freedman told CNN in an email. ""We have no information about the types of cancers women developed and what treatment they had either, both of which impact mortality from breast cancer."" 

In short, from the data included in the study, the researchers can't conclusively say when any of the patients started being screened for breast cancer or how that was linked to their risk of death from the disease, she said.

Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered several tombs and chapels dating back around 3,300 years in an ancient cemetery at the site of Saqqara. 

The biggest tomb belonged to a man named ""Panehsy"" who was the ""overseer of the temple of Amun,"" Lara Weiss

Weiss noted that Panehsy ""had a very nice tomb with wonderful reliefs which show large traces of colour."" Inscriptions indicate that he didn't have any children, and that an employee arranged for offerings to be brought to the tomb. Human remains were found in Panehsy's tomb, but they seem to be from people buried at a later time and will be studied in detail in 2024, Weiss said.

Another newly unearthed tomb belongs to a man named ""Yuyu,"" who was a ""gold foil maker and hence a specialized artist in the royal treasury,"" Weiss said. While Yuyu's tomb is smaller than Paneshy's, it has some remarkable artwork that depicts ""many interesting details such as many barque [a ship] bearers and a huge procession of mourners,"" noted Weiss. Four generations of his family are depicted, including ""his parents, himself and his wife, his brother with wife and children, his own children and grandchildren,"" Weiss said.

One of the other newfound tombs, whose owner is unknown, has statues carved in relief and appears to show four people who likely belong to the same family. The statues appear to be unfinished, but the design of the statues is similar to those found in a nearby tomb belonging to a couple named Maya and Merit who lived about 50 years before this tomb was built, Weiss noted.

Live Science contacted scholars not involved with the excavation to get their thoughts. Francesco Tiradritti
(opens in new tab)
, an Egyptology professor at the Kore University of Enna in Italy, was impressed by the relief. ""The quality of this relief is amazing,"" Tiradritti said, noting that ""the artist played on the tridimensionality and frontality of the four figures with a consciousness rare for the art of Ancient Egypt."" Tiradritti said that the relief reminds him of monuments found in a necropolis near Memphis that date back to the Old Kingdom (circa 2649 B.C. to 2150 B.C.), a time when pyramids were being constructed in Egypt. 

The work at Saqqara is ongoing and is being conducted by scholars from the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden and the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy.

Deserts can take many forms — including sweeping sand dunes, rocky canyons, sagebrush steppes and polar ice fields. But they're united by one thing: a lack of rainfall. Generally speaking, anywhere that gets less than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain a year counts as a desert, said Lynn Fenstermaker
(opens in new tab)
, an ecologist at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada. 

Of course, that lack of rain means deserts are, famously, dry. But why do some places on Earth get much less rain than others? In other words, why are deserts dry?

Global air circulation patterns are the biggest reason, Fenstermaker said. Solar energy hits Earth most directly at the equator, heating the air and evaporating moisture from it. That warm, dry air rises and travels toward the poles. It tends to sink again around 30 degrees latitude, Fenstermaker explained. This circulation pattern is called a Hadley cell, and it drives the trade winds, which fueled early exploration of the globe by seafaring explorers. It's also why many of the world's biggest deserts — such as the Sahara and the Gobi in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Kalahari in the Southern Hemisphere — are at these midlatitudes.

But the story is more complicated than that. Wind patterns interact with topography to influence where deserts are found. For example, air that sweeps in from the ocean and hits a mountain range will release its moisture as rainfall or snow onto the slopes as the air rises. But by the time the air crosses the mountains and sinks down the other side, it's dry. In California, for example, the Mojave Desert sits in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, Fenstermaker said.

Sometimes, inland areas are drier because they're so far from a large body of water that air blowing in has lost all its moisture by the time it arrives, said Andreas Prein
(opens in new tab)
, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. This is the case with the Gobi Desert in Central Asia, which is also shielded by the Himalayas. 

On the other hand, coastal doesn't always mean wet. Cold ocean currents colliding with the air moving into the coast can create fog. When that fog moves over land, the moisture stays in the air instead of falling as rain. This can create deserts that abut the ocean, such as the Atacama in Chile, one of the driest places on Earth.

Not all deserts are hot, either; parts of the Arctic and Antarctic count as deserts. Cold air can't hold moisture as well as warm air does, Prein said. So the frigid temperatures at the poles lead to very little rainfall, even though ample water is stored in the ground as ice.

As global climate patterns shift, so do deserts. For example, thousands of years ago, the Sahara was covered in grasslands and tropical forests
(opens in new tab)
. And today, climate change is reshaping the boundaries of deserts around the world.

""The Hadley cell is expected to spread north and southwards because of climate change,"" Prein said, expanding the zone that's ripe for desert formation. Warmer temperatures could accelerate the shift by increasing evaporation of water and drying the air even further. Beyond just rainfall, it's the balance of precipitation and evaporation that defines a desert, Prein added.

""Globally, with warming, what we're anticipating is that we're going to have more evaporation, and just expansion of existing desert regions,"" Fenstermaker noted.

Human pressure on landscapes is contributing, too. Cutting down trees to plant crops removes native vegetation, and some research suggests that deforestation in the tropics is reducing precipitation
(opens in new tab)
. If more water evaporates instead of being held in the soil by plants, a feedback loop nudges landscapes drier and drier. Semiarid areas on the fringes of existing deserts are particularly vulnerable.

""It's often compounding factors that help deserts to grow,"" Prein said. ""It's not only human activity, or climate change, or the natural climate variability, but it's everything on top of each other that brings ecosystems over the tipping point.""

Found a minor mistake. After acknowledging that water evaporates closer to the equator, it states that dry air travels toward the poles. If it’s dry, what moisture is being carried? How does it even rain if evaporation forms dry air?! That doesn’t make sense.

Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for ""The End is Nye"" series on Peacock TV.

What would Bill Nye the Science Guy get our home planet for Earth Day?

The ultimate gift: fusion energy.

""We need electricity,"" Nye told Live Science in an exclusive interview on Thursday (April 20). ""We need not only what we can get right now with existing technologies — with wind, and solar and geothermal energy — but we need that so-called baseload. We need electricity when the sun's not shining and the wind's not blowing."" And although powerful, nuclear energy carries the risk of a meltdown and creates nuclear waste, he added. 

RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...

Fusion is an achievement any scientist would go starry-eyed over. With nuclear fusion — a process that smashes two light atoms together to create a heavier, new element, just as the sun does when it fuses hydrogen atoms together to make helium — humans would have clean, nearly limitless energy.

Scientists have spent decades searching for this elusive source of near unlimited power, and are closer than ever to achieving fusion, but despite major advancements, useful, cost-effective nuclear fusion is still many years away. To achieve such a feat would be an invaluable present for Earth Day on Saturday (April 22). It would also make for a nice gesture from the Science Guy to the planet given that in Nye's latest TV series, ""The End is Nye,"" Mother Nature basically kills him in every single episode. 

The series, released in December 2022, details how a multitude of planet-wrecking disasters, such as simultaneous record-breaking hurricanes; a swarm of earthquakes and tsunamis; harrowing dust storms and a string of space rocks slamming into Earth, could play out, should they come to pass.

""I get killed seven times in six shows,"" Nye said. ""But then I come back.""

Watch The End is Nye on NBC Peacock: $4.99/month for Premium or $9.99/month for Premium Plus (no ads)

Sign up to Peacock to watch Bill Nye as he explores all the world of disasters, both natural and man-made, and explain how we can survive the worst that the world can throw at us.

VIEW DEAL

In every episode, with cameos from executive producer Seth MacFarlane, Nye investigates how humans could exacerbate these disasters through so-called ""acts of cow,"" which refers to a cow that allegedly kicked over a lantern and started the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. (Despite popular use of the phrase, this story may not be true and may have racist overtones, as the woman who owned the cow was reportedly poor, Irish and an easy scapegoat to frame for the tragedy, Nye noted.) It would be an act of cow, for instance, for government agencies to fail to act if potentially hazardous asteroids were zooming toward Earth, or if officials didn't shut down electrical grids before a solar storm threatened to fry their electrical components to smithereens.

As he walks us through the science of each disaster in the show, Nye provides ""evidence-based optimism"" about how we could form scientifically informed plans to avoid such acts of cow and protect against the worst of these chilling scenarios. 

""Well look, you have to be optimistic, or you're not gonna get anything done — and I'm talking about anything,"" Nye said. ""If you think you're gonna lose the soccer game, you will lose."" Except in this case, the result of the soccer game concerns the fate of all humanity.

But in addition to optimism, we also need a plan, and that's where science comes in, he said. ""You've got to have a plan, not just hope and optimism,"" he said. ""And that plan comes from science. From evaluating evidence.""

It's no wonder Nye wants to gift Earth nuclear fusion, as this would help abate a lot of humanity's problems, including human-caused climate change, which is linked to a host of disasters, including increasingly severe hurricanes, heat waves and droughts that also grow more frequent by the year.

In an example of an evidence-based plan that could one day come to fruition, fusion could help raise the standard of living for people worldwide by providing energy that could power the internet, which in turn could deliver education, especially to families and women, he added. ""Then, I believe we could invest in and have clean water for everybody on Earth,"" he said. ""That's it: change the world.""

Only humans are capable of formulating such forward-thinking plans that could protect and elevate our species. The dinosaurs, he said, were not so lucky when the asteroid collided with Earth 66 million years ago. It's not like they had the means to design and test a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission like NASA did recently by using a spacecraft crash into to change the trajectory of an asteroid.

""There is no evidence that the ancient dinosaurs had a space program,"" Nye said. ""If they did, it wasn't good enough, let's face it.""

"19 days ago","Aspirational recycling: How bad is it to put things in the recycling that can't be recycled?","The environmental impact of aspirational recycling, where people try to recycle items that can't be recycled, can do more harm than good.","How sure are you that that item can be recycled? (Image credit: Maskot via Getty Images)

Throwing bottles in the garbage instead of the recycling can isn't great for the environment. But over-recycling can be a far more insidious problem. When we indiscriminately toss garbage into recycling bins — a practice known as aspirational recycling or ""wishcycling"" — the admixture may well end up redirected to the landfill or gumming up machines at processing facilities. 

""Aspirational recycling, like any type of recycling contamination, is a big problem,"" Jordan P. Howell
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of sustainable business at Rowan University and author of ""Garbage in the Garden State
(opens in new tab)
"" (Rutgers University Press, 2023), told Live Science in an email. ""Any type of contamination lowers the overall quality of stuff leaving the recycling facility. If the quality gets too low, then a buyer might reject a shipment of material.""

In some cases, wishcycling appears to be driven by overzealous (if misplaced) environmentalism. Two field studies conducted in 2020
(opens in new tab)
 suggest that labeling recycling cans with pro-environmental messages may guilt passersby into recycling items that cannot be recycled.

But the most common cause is more likely to be downright confusion. Does our town still take bottles? Where do I put old phone books? Changes to the types of items a local recycling program accepts can easily snowball into misconceptions about what can be recycled and what belongs in the trash. ""Folks might put something in the bin that used to be collected, but then markets and policies change and that material is no longer accepted,"" Howell said.

Related: How much plastic actually gets recycled?

This confusion is evident in surveys conducted by Janet Yang
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of communication at the University at Buffalo. Yang told Live Science in an email that more than 20% of respondents to her surveys admitted they were not sure whether plastic, metal, glass and paper belong in the home recycling. More than 30% of respondents didn't know what to do with plastic shopping bags, drinking glasses, disposable coffee cups and plastic beverage pouches. Half thought that the ""100% recycled"" symbol found on some products means that product is recyclable (it's not, rather this symbol means that it was made from recyclable materials); two-thirds applied the same incorrect reasoning to ""eco-friendly"" labels, which actually means that an item is sustainably produced and may or may not also mean that it is recyclable. 

""The U.S. produces 12% of global municipal solid waste, with only 4% of the world’s population,"" Yang said. ""We should encourage Americans to recycle better and recycle more.""

Aspirational recycling is rampant — with one report
(opens in new tab)
 estimating that the recycling contamination rate (where the wrong items are put in the recycling can) in the U.S. is 17% by weight. Such high levels of contamination pose a significant threat to sustainability overall, while also increasing costs.

Processing machines at recycling facilities get jammed up with materials that cannot be recycled. (Image credit: wingedwolf via Getty Images)

""Materials that cannot be recycled can jam up processing machines at recycling processing facilities which may cause enormous delays,"" Yang said. ""This means more economic burden due to damaged sorting systems and a need for more labor to fix them. It also causes more harm than good to the environment since sometimes a whole batch may need to be thrown out, due to contaminants.""

And the stakes have only risen since 2018, when China — the largest importer of recyclables from the U.S. — implemented a policy cracking down on contaminants and imposing strict limits. One University at Buffalo study
(opens in new tab)
 from 2022 estimated the amount of plastic in landfills has increased by 23% since China began turning away the U.S.'s tainted recycling shipments.

Aspirational recycling breaks so many crucial cogs in the sustainability machine that local authorities sometimes come up with creative solutions to tackle it. Alachua County, Florida occasionally leaves notes in residential recycling cans with high rates of contamination, and an initiative in Manchester, England, rewarded cans with low contamination rates with tags that were redeemable for rewards
(opens in new tab)
 that could be donated to any local school.

In towns without a carrot or stick initiative, one approach may be to focus on the items that are most recyclable. ""Recycling is a benefit when material is collected and successfully reused, and this happens a lot with aluminum, other metals, and cardboard,"" Howell said. ""But a lot of plastic actually isn’t that useful even when it’s collected properly. The market just isn’t there."" 

But the best way to fight back against recycling contamination is to remove the need for significant recycling in the first place. ""Consider reducing — saying no to plastic cutlery when ordering take-out — or reusing — getting your own coffee cup or using your reusable grocery bag,"" Yang said. ""Make recycling your last resort.""

"19 days ago","Will Earth ever lose its moon?","The moon is slowly creeping away from Earth, but will we actually lose the moon before the sun turns into a red giant and destroys us both?","Will Earth lose its moon before the sun destroys us?  (Image credit: Jeremy Horner)

The moon's orbit around Earth appears so regular that civilizations have based the month on lunar motion for thousands of years. However, the moon is actually creeping slowly away from Earth. So will Earth lose its moon at some point?

Scientists determined the rate at which the moon is drifting away from Earth with help from reflective panels that NASA
(opens in new tab)
 placed there during the Apollo missions. For more than 50 years, researchers have fired laser beams from Earth at these mirrors and measured how long it took to detect the reflected pulses. Using the speed of light, scientists estimated that the moon is straying away from Earth by about 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) per year, roughly the rate at which fingernails grow, according to NASA
(opens in new tab)
.

The moon is moving away from Earth because of the gravitational effects that each has on the other. The moon's gravitational pull forces Earth's oceans to bulge toward it, resulting in the lunar tides, NASA said
(opens in new tab)
. Earth's gravity causes similar tidal effects on the moon, making our natural satellite slightly football-shaped.

The gravitational pull from Earth's tidal bulge drags on the moon. Meanwhile, the oceans shift because of the lunar tides, exerting friction on Earth's surface and thus slowing the planet's rotation, Madelyn Broome
(opens in new tab)
, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told Live Science. About 4.5 billion years ago, ""when the moon was first formed, the rotation rate of the Earth would have been significantly faster, with a day length of about five hours,"" Broome said.

Related: Who owns the moon?

All of these forces work to sling the moon farther away from Earth.

""Since the Earth and the moon are part of the same gravitationally interacting system, total angular momentum must be conserved — stay the same — between the two,"" Broome explained. ""Angular momentum describes the energy contained by something that is spinning. The faster you spin, the more angular momentum you have. The slower you spin, the less.""

However, ""it's not just the rate of spinning that affects angular momentum,"" Broome added. ""How far you are from the center of the system also matters. Further means the angular momentum of the system goes up. Closer means your angular momentum goes down. ""

In the case of Earth and the moon, ""as the Earth's spin slows down, in order for angular momentum to be conserved, something has to increase the angular momentum of the system,"" Broome said. ""What increases angular momentum? An orbiting object like the moon getting further away.""

The moon likely formed from debris that resulted from a crash between the nascent Earth and a Mars-size object, according to The University of Arizona
(opens in new tab)
. Tidal forces have helped pull the moon to its current average distance of about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) from Earth, according to the Royal Observatory
(opens in new tab)
 in Greenwich, England. 

Tidal effects are also slowing the rate at which the moon rotates on its axis, resulting in the moon ""tidally locking"" with Earth — that is, always displaying the same face to our planet. These forces are also reducing the speed at which Earth spins. 

In about 50 billion years, Earth's slowing rotation would make it tidally lock with the moon so that Earth would permanently show just one side to the moon, Jean Creighton
(opens in new tab)
, director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, told Live Science. At this point, the moon and Earth would stop moving away from each other, Eric Klumpe
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of astronomy at Middle Tennessee State University, told Live Science.

—What would happen if the moon were twice as close to Earth?

—If you're on the moon, does the Earth appear to go through phases?

However, about 5 billion years from now, as the sun begins to die, it will swell to become a red giant star, ""at which point the Earth-moon system will almost certainly be disrupted and destroyed,"" David Trilling
(opens in new tab)
, chair of the Astronomy and Planetary Science Department at Northern Arizona University, told Live Science.

In about 5 billion years, if the moon keeps drifting away from Earth at its current rate of retreat, the moon will have moved about another 117,000 miles (189,000 km) away when it gets consumed by the red giant sun, Broome said.

All in all, the moon will not leave Earth, or vice versa. Rather, the sun will obliterate them both.

Baby hellbender salamanders don't stand a chance against their fathers who have gone rogue and started cannibalizing their offspring.

For the past eight years, scientists from Virginia Tech have been studying the behavior of hellbender salamanders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis), a species of giant amphibians that inhabit the frigid waters of southwestern Virginia rivers and are considered the largest salamanders in North America, growing about 2 feet (0.69 meters) long and weighing up to 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms).

The researchers noticed that male salamanders were more prone to eating their young if they resided in areas affected by deforestation.

In fact, in the past 50 years, hellbender salamander numbers have decreased across the United States, and the researchers cited disease, poaching, climate change and habitat loss due to deforestation as possible factors leading to this cannibalistic behavior, The New York Times reported

Typically, male salamanders are doting fathers that stick around for months after fertilizing the eggs to fend off possible predators, eating only around 14% of the offspring that have low chances for survival. However, in areas where deforestation is an issue, this tendency to chow down on their young tripled. Hopkins suspects that changes in water chemistry due to deforestation could be depleting the salamanders' food supply and thus causing this shift in behavior, according to The New York Times. 

Infanticide has become so commonplace among these jumbo salamanders that the researchers worry that the practice could lead to the species' extinction.

, an ecologist at Virginia Tech and lead author of a new paper describing the research, told The New York Times.

Male hellbender salamanders aren't unique in their hankering to eat their young. Filial cannibalism is also common in other species, like cane toads and Baltic comb jellies.

The research by Hopkins and his colleagues will be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal The American Naturalist

Today it is used in the coronation of the United Kingdom's monarch. (Image credit: Historic Environment Scotland)

When King Charles III is crowned in London on May 6, the coronation ceremony will involve the Stone of Destiny, a Scottish carved seat that's at least 800 years old. Despite its long history, scientists only recently noticed never-before-documented symbols and other anomalies on the stone, they announced in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. 

These anomalies — a copper alloy stain and the remains of gypsum plaster — suggest that the historical block, also known as the Stone of Scone, has unknown aspects of its history that aren't recorded in documents.

The stone was used in the coronation of Scotland's monarchs in the 13th century, and today, it is used in the coronation of the United Kingdom's monarch. As part of the modern-day ceremony, the stone is placed within the coronation chair that the monarch sits on. The stone was captured and moved from Scotland to England in 1296 and was not returned until the 20th century. Its history before the 13th century is unclear.

Now, scientists with Historic Environment Scotland, a public body that takes care of the stone, have performed a laser scan of the artifact and conducted scientific tests, revealing new information on it.

Roman numerals?

Markings that look like Roman numerals were found on the stone during the scans. (Image credit: Historic Environment Scotland)

Among the finds were markings that look like Roman numerals. They include three X-shaped marks, followed by a marking that looks like a ""v."" 

""The Roman numerals haven't been recorded before,"" Ewan Hyslop
(opens in new tab)
, head of research & climate change at Historic Environment Scotland, told Live Science in an email. ""We do not know why they were carved or what they signify, but we hope that this will be an area for further research."" 

The carvings might not even be Roman numerals, but rather other symbols, said Ewan Campbell
(opens in new tab)
, a senior lecturer of archaeology at the University of Glasgow in the U.K., who was not involved in the new research.

""I think these are dubious as numerals — more likely crude crosses,"" Campbell told Live Science in an email. Based on the wearing of the stone and position of the markings, Campbell suspects they weren't etched into the stone until sometime after it was moved from Scotland to England in 1296.

Hints of a relic and plaster

The ""Stone of Destiny"" was scanned and a digital model was created. (Image credit: Historic Environment Scotland)

The research team also identified a copper alloy stain on the stone by using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, a relatively non-destructive technique that works by measuring the chemical composition of materials
(opens in new tab)
 such as rocks, minerals and sediments. The finding suggests that a copper or brass object was placed on the stone for a period of time at some point in its history. 

""By far, the more important result is the presence of copper staining on the surface,"" Campbell said. ""This suggest[s] some object, possibly a relic such as a saint's bell, was positioned on the stone for a long period.""

Relics were popular in the Middle Ages and sometimes consisted of physical remains, such as the bones of a saint or holy person placed in a metal container, such as copper. Relics could also be artifacts associated with such a person. For example, pieces of wood that were reportedly from the cross that Jesus was crucified on were popular relics. 

The analysis also revealed the presence of gypsum plaster on the Stone of Destiny. This suggests that at some point a plaster cast of the artifact may have been made. 

The existence of a cast is unexpected, as no records mention a cast being made of the stone, Sally Foster
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of heritage and conservation at the University of Stirling, told Live Science in an email. ""I have not encountered any stories of, or evidence for, the stone being replicated in this way,"" Foster said.

RELATED STORIES

—8 truly dysfunctional royal families

—Who inherits the British throne?

While it's not clear how the gypsum plaster got on the stone, the recent scans and tests will make it easier for scholars to study the stone. ""The Stone of Destiny is rarely moved and it's not easy for scholars and the public to look at it in its entirety, close-up or for any extended period,""  

The laser scan led to the creation of a virtual 3D image of the stone that is now available online
(opens in new tab)
 to scholars and the public alike.

""The availability of the [online model] now allows us all to see and review some of that evidence for ourselves — we can all become detectives if we look for the ways in which the stone has been modified through time by activities that left their marks on its fabric,"" Foster said.

(Image credit: Cavan Images via Getty Images)

Our ""biological age,"" which reflects signs of age-related decline in our cells and tissues, doesn't steadily increase along with our chronological age. Instead, new research suggests that biological aging can accelerate during stressful events and then reverse after those events.

In other words, there are measurable biological markers linked to age-related changes in cell function, and these markers can appear in times of stress and then disappear during recovery.

Scientists already knew that biological age's relationship to chronological age was somewhat flexible. But now, researchers say they have uncovered the possibility of biological age reversal.

Biological age is ""much more dynamic than people previously thought,"" Jesse Poganik
(opens in new tab)
, a postdoctoral researcher and chemical biologist at Harvard Medical School who led the new research, told Live Science. ""You can have these very severe stress events, which trigger an increase in the biological age, but it can be short-lived, if the stress is short-lived, and then the age can be restored.""

In a study published Friday (April 21) in the journal Cell Metabolism
(opens in new tab)
, researchers examined the effects of short-term but extreme physiological stress on the biological ages of mice and humans. 

They used what are known as DNA methylation clocks to quantify epigenetic (meaning ""above"" or ""on top of"" genetics) modifications in the structure of DNA that are tightly linked to aging. DNA methylation refers to a process where small molecules, called methyl groups, are added to the surface of a DNA molecule and help control how and when particular genes can be turned ""on"" or ""off."" Evidence suggests that patterns of DNA methylation shift across the life span and reflect biological aging. 

While these epigenetic changes are linked to aging, in this study, the team didn't directly test what impact these changes had on cellular functions.

The team first tested the flexibility of biological age in mice. They surgically joined pairs of young and older mice so that their bloodstreams merged for three months, which led to a significant increase in the biological age of the younger mice. After separating the mice for two months, the researchers found that the increase in age had been reversed.

Next, the researchers investigated shifts in the biological ages of people who were either undergoing major surgery, giving birth or receiving intensive care for severe COVID-19 infections. Blood samples from older emergency surgery patients showed a spike in biological age within 24 hours of their operations, but their ages dropped back down to their pre-surgery levels within one to two weeks.

—We're nowhere near reaching the maximum human life span, controversial study suggests

The COVID-19 patients who survived the infection, however, did not bounce back so quickly. While women returned to their pre-COVID biological ages within two weeks, men did not seem to recover. This means that, from a biological age perspective, the time frame for recovery might depend on the type of stress and on sex.

In blood samples from pregnant people, the researchers detected a peak in biological age around the time the baby was born, which returned to its previous level within six weeks postpartum, on average.

While the study makes no conclusions about the effect of these biological U-turns on lifelong aging, failure to recover from stressful events may speed up aging, Poganik said. ""Over the lifespan, you can accelerate the entire trajectory.""

These fluctuations in biological age, which the researchers say are clearly visible in physiologically taxing situations, are unlikely to arise from everyday stress. ""You probably wouldn't see it with mild day-to-day, having a bad day at work, kind of stress,"" Poganik said.

The results may point to an opportunity to test anti-aging drugs. ""If you can identify a model where age is transiently elevated, you could potentially use recovery from that elevation to test the effects of different drugs,"" Poganik said.

A great white shark washed up on South Carolina's Myrtle Beach earlier this month in a rare and unusual stranding — and the reason behind the beaching remains a mystery. 

The 10-foot-long (3 meters) female was alive when locals saw it in the shallows on April 3. ""There were multiple attempts to get the shark back in the ocean but it kept washing back ashore and eventually stopped breathing,"" Crystal Alden, a local who participated in the rescue effort, wrote in a post on Facebook
(opens in new tab)

In a series of pictures attached to the social media post, the shark appears to be stuck in a shallow pool. Its dorsal fin, eyes and gills are clearly visible, white the rest of its body is submerged. More photos show the shark lying in the back of a pickup truck with scratches to the underside of its mouth and sharp teeth exposed between protruded jaws. In the final picture posted by Alden, the young female hangs from a digger by its tail.

Biologists from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNP) and visiting scientists from Georgia Aquarium and Ripley's Aquariums, in Toronto, Canada, conducted a necropsy on the great white (Carcharodon carcharias) — but they could not determine the cause of death.

""A necropsy revealed nodules on the shark’s spleen but no conclusive cause of illness; our biologists are sending off tissue samples for further analysis to hopefully learn more,"" SCDNR representatives wrote in a Facebook post
(opens in new tab)
 on April 6.

The investigation could take several months. ""We’ve sent the tissues to a lab that has experience performing pathological analysis on white shark tissue samples,"" an SCDNR spokesperson told Live Science in an email. ""We have not received results yet and think it may take one or two months before a report is completed.""

The beaching is a very rare event, according to the SCDNP’s Facebook post. ""While it’s not uncommon for large coastal sharks, whales, dolphins and sea turtles to become stranded on the shore when ill/injured, a white shark stranding in South Carolina is unusual,"" the SCDNR wrote. ""White sharks are typically only winter visitors to South Carolina waters.""

Great white sharks along the East Coast
(opens in new tab)
 tend to spend the summer and fall in northern waters, feeding on high-calorie prey like seals. They migrate south in the winter months to the warmer waters off the more southerly states.

Employees with the SCDNR said they did not recognize the young shark as it had not been tagged, and that it would not have been a danger for beach-goers.

The stranding is a rare opportunity to collect data on great white sharks, according to the SCDNR. ""We can’t confirm with certainty the last time a white shark was stranded on a South Carolina beach,"" the spokesperson told Live Science. ""The last time the S.C. Department of Natural Resources was able to conduct a necropsy on a white shark was about 15 years ago on a shark stranded on Morris Island. That necropsy was done in the field, which limited our ability to collect tissue samples.""

During the late Triassic period roughly 230 million years ago, a squat reptile with a beak-like mouth lived in what is now Wyoming.

Paleontologists identified the remains of the herbivorous reptile, which is a stem, or early archosaur and therefore a distant relative of modern-day birds and crocodiles, as a new genus and species of rhynchosaur, a group of plant eaters defined by their parrot-like beaks. The team described the newly identified species, which they dubbed Beesiiwo cooowuse, in a study published April 10 in the journal Diversity
(opens in new tab)
.

""Beesiiwo was not particularly big,"" co-author David Lovelace
(opens in new tab)
, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Live Science in an email. He estimates that an adult probably weighed between 10 and 15 pounds (5 to 7 kilograms) and was roughly 2 feet (0.6 m) long.

Researchers can only speculate the specific plants that it ate. 

""We do know from paleo pollen and plant remains that there were definitely conifers, ferns and horsetail plants around that may have contributed to its diet,"" Lovelace said. Its beaked mouth ""could very well have been used for stripping or clipping leaves, but again, there is no direct evidence of this that I know of.""

In total, paleontologists unearthed five rhynchosaur specimens at the Popo Agie Formation, a Triassic geological formation located in the Bighorn Mountains, part of the northern Rocky Mountains. Three of the specimens, including fragments of upper and lower jawbones, belonged to the new species. 

Because the fossils were located on Native American land, the researchers partnered with leaders from the Northern Arapaho Tribal Historic Preservation Office to name the new species Beesiiwo cooowuse, which, in the Arapaho language, means ""big lizard from the Alcova area"" of central Wyoming, according to a statement

The naming is part of a collaboration among the Arapaho people, students from Fort Washakie Schools (FWS) located on the Wind River Indian Reservation and the university to decolonize paleontology. Despite the abundance of fossils discovered in the American West, it's the first time a specimen found on Native land has been named in the Arapaho language. 

""This is an exciting place to do fieldwork because this geological formation hasn't really been studied in nearly a century,"" Lovelace said in the statement. ""We get this multicultural, multigenerational interaction in the field where elders, FWS students, UW-Madison students and scientists are all working together to integrate Western science, Native science and traditional ecological knowledge.""

"20 days ago","AI's 'unsettling' rollout is exposing its flaws. How concerned should we be?","AI isn't close to becoming sentient, but it could be disruptive anyway.","The ChatGPT website displayed on a tablet in Madrid, Spain. (Image credit: Europa Press News / Contributor)

The CEO of Google and Alphabet is warning that society needs to move quickly to adapt to the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). 

""This is going to impact every product across every company,"" Sundar Pichai said April 16 in an interview with ""60 Minutes
(opens in new tab)
."" Last month, Google released its chatbot, Bard — a competitor of ChatGPT, the widely known chatbot produced by OpenAI — despite scathing reviews in internal testing, according to The Byte
(opens in new tab)
. 

Programs like ChatGPT and Bard can produce confident-sounding text in response to user queries, and they're already finding a foothold in some tasks, such as coding, said Ernest Davis
(opens in new tab)
, a computer scientist at New York University. However, they do often flub basic facts and ""hallucinate,"" meaning they make up information. In one recent example, ChatGPT invented a sexual harassment scandal
(opens in new tab)
 and named a real law professor as the perpetrator, complete with citations of nonexistent newspaper articles about the case.

The power of these programs — combined with their imperfections, has experts concerned about the rapid rollout of AI. While a ""Terminator"" Skynet situation is a long way off, AI programs have the capacity to amplify human bias, make it harder to discern true information from false, and disrupt employment, experts told Live Science. 

Related: DeepMind AI has discovered the structure of nearly every protein known to science 

Benefit or bias?

During the ""60 Minutes"" discussion, interviewer Scott Pelley called the Bard chatbot's capabilities ""unsettling"" and said ""Bard appears to be thinking."" 

However, large language models such as Bard are not sentient, said Sara Goudarzi
(opens in new tab)
, associate editor of disruptive technologies for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. ""I think that really needs to be clear,"" Goudarzi said. 

These AI chatbots produce human-sounding writing by making statistical inferences about what words are likely to come next in a sentence, after being trained on huge amounts of preexisting text. This method means that while AI may sound confident about whatever it's saying, it doesn't really understand it, said Damien Williams
(opens in new tab)
, an assistant professor in the School of Data Science at the University of North Carolina who studies technology and society. 

These AI chatbots are ""not trying to give you right answers; they're trying to give you an answer you like,"" Williams told Live Science. He gave an example of a recent AI panel he attended: The introductory speaker asked ChatGPT to produce a bio for Shannon Vallor
(opens in new tab)
, an AI ethicist at The University of Edinburgh in the U.K. The program tried to give Vallor a more prestigious educational background than she actually had, because it simply wasn't statistically likely that someone of her stature in the field went to community college and a public university. 

It's easy for AI to not only copy but amplify any human biases that exist in the training data. For example, in 2018, Amazon dropped an AI résumé-sorting tool that showed persistent bias against women. The AI ranked résumés with female-sounding names as less qualified than those with male-sounding names, Williams said.

""That's because the data it had been trained on was the résumé sorting of human beings,"" Williams said. 

AI programs like ChatGPT are programmed to try to avoid racist, sexist or otherwise undesirable responses. But the truth is that there is no such thing as an ""objective"" AI, Williams said. AI will always include human values and human biases, because it's built by humans. 

""One way or another, it's going to have some kind of perspective that undergirds how it gets built,"" Williams said. ""The question is, do we want to let that happen accidentally as we have been doing … or do we want to be intentional about it?"" 

Building AI safeguards 

Pichai warned that AI could increase the scale of disinformation. Already, AI-generated videos dubbed ""deepfakes"" are becoming more convincing and harder to discern from reality. Want to animate the ""Mona Lisa"" or bring Marie Curie back to life? Deepfake tech can already do a convincing job. 

Pichai said societies need to develop regulation and pen treaties to ensure that AI is used responsibly. 

""It's not for a company to decide,"" Pichai told ""60 Minutes."" ""This is why I think the development of this needs to include not just engineers but social scientists, ethicists, philosophers and so on.""

—Meta's new AI just predicted the shape of 600 million proteins in 2 weeks 

So far, regulations around AI largely fall under laws designed to cover older technologies, Williams said. But there have been attempts at a more comprehensive regulatory structure. In 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published the ""AI Bill of Rights
(opens in new tab)
,"" a blueprint meant to promote ethical, human-centered AI development. The document covers issues of equity and possible harm, Williams said, but it leaves out some concerning problems, such as the development and deployment of AI by law enforcement and the military. 

Increasingly, Williams said, political nominees for federal agencies and departments are being drawn from people who have a sense of the costs and benefits of AI. Alvaro Bedoya, the current commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, was the founding director of the Georgetown Law Center for Privacy and Technology and has expertise in technology and ethics, Williams said, while Alondra Nelson, former interim director of the OSTP, has had a long career studying science, technology and inequalities. But there is a long way to go to build technological literacy among politicians and policymakers, Williams said. 

""We are still in the space of letting various large corporations direct the development and distribution of what could be very powerful technologies, but technologies which are opaque and which are being embedded in our day-to-day lives in ways over which we have no control,"" he said.

"20 days ago","Eerie sounds triggered by plasma waves hitting Earth's magnetic field captured in new NASA sound clip","NASA has converted years of satellite data on Earth's magnetosphere into eerie sound clips that can be used by citizen scientists to help make new discoveries.","NASA has released an eerie new sound clip full of high frequency ""whistles, crunches, and whooshes"" created when waves of plasma slam into our planet's magnetic field lines and make them ""vibrate like the plucked strings of a harp,"" the space agency said.

The new audio

, released April 17, sounds like it comes straight out of a low-budget sci-fi movie. But it is actually part of NASA's new Heliophysics Audified: Resonances in Plasmas (HARP) project, which turns data about Earth's magnetosphere — a magnetic bubble around our planet's outer atmosphere that shields us from dangerous solar storms and radiation from the sun — into sound bites.

The space between Earth and the sun may appear empty, but in reality, it is filled with plasma, or ionized gas, and other highly energetic particles that stream from the sun toward our planet, either as slow-moving solar winds or as fast bursts during solar storms. When these plasma waves hit the Earth's magnetosphere they create fluctuations, or vibrations, in the plasma shield, which give off ""ultralow-frequency"" radio waves, NASA representatives wrote in a statement

NASA's Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms (THEMIS) mission, which consists of five satellites launched in 2007 that traverse the magnetosphere, has recorded more than 15 years of these ultra low-frequency waves. The HARP project has now converted the THEMIS data into audible sounds to make it easier to identify irregularities in the Earth's plasma shield. Such analyses could lead to new discoveries about the magnetosphere and the sun.

The aim of the HARP project is to enable citizen scientists to listen to the sound clips and highlight unusual patterns for researchers to investigate more closely. Turning the data into sound helps to make it easier for people to spot irregularities in patterns, researchers wrote.

""The human sense of hearing is an amazing tool,"" Martin Archer
(opens in new tab)
, a magnetosphere expert at Imperial College London and HARP team member, said in the statement. ""We're essentially trained from birth to recognize patterns and pick out different sound sources. We can innately do some pretty crazy analysis that outperforms even some of our most advanced computer algorithms.""

The team has already made a surprising discovery from their preliminary sound bites, which contain patterns that go against what they previously predicted. They have dubbed these unexpected sounds the ""reverse harp"" and will study the intriguing perturbations in more depth in the future. They hope the project will uncover even more unexpected discoveries in the near future.

This is not the first time that scientists have recorded sounds coming from the magnetosphere. 

On Feb. 17, an X-class solar flare — the most powerful class the sun can produce — slammed into Earth, causing widespread radio blackouts. Amateur radio astronomer and citizen scientist Thomas Ashcraft

"20 days ago","See Mercury's giant, comet-like tail in stunning new image as it passes close to the sun","Shortly after Mercury reached its closest point to the sun, its massive, comet-like tail became unusually visible in the night sky and was captured in a stunning new photo.","Mercury's comet-like tail streaks across the sky in this image captured April 12. (Image credit: Dr. Sebastian Voltmer | www.voltmer.photo)

Mercury has been spotted cosplaying as a comet over the last few days when the sun's neighboring planet reached its nearest point to our star, exposing its massive, streaking tail in the night sky. One astrophotographer captured a truly epic shot of the charade. 

Comets are orbiting chunks of frozen rocks, gases and dust that are almost always seen with distinctive twin tails trailing behind them — one made of gas that leaks from their interiors and another created by dust from their surfaces. These two tails are blown away from the comet in the same direction by charged particles from the sun known as solar wind. 

Mercury, the solar system's smallest planet, has one comet-like tail made predominantly of sodium ions, which are scattered from the planet's surface by solar wind and micro-meteor impacts. Researchers have known about Mercury's tail since 2001 and have since discovered that it grows and shrinks based on the planet's proximity to the sun. At its peak, the tail stretches to around 14.9 million miles (24 million kilometers) long, according to Spaceweather.com
(opens in new tab)
, which is around 62 times greater than the distance between Earth and the moon. The tail stretches this huge distance because Mercury has a very weak atmosphere and is close to the sun, which makes it easy for the solar wind to rip up the planet's surface.

For unknown reasons, Mercury's tail is most visible from Earth exactly 16 days after perihelion, or the point at which the planet is closest to the sun, according to Spaceweather.com. Mercury reached perihelion on April 1, meaning its tail appeared brightest on April 17. But on April 12, astrophotographer Sebastian Voltmer
(opens in new tab)
 captured a stunning image
(opens in new tab)
 of the planet's tail from a spot near Spicheren, a commune in northeastern France. 

RELATED STORIES

—Weird! Mercury's scorching temps may actually lead to ice.

—The sun has blasted Mercury with a plasma wave 

To a casual observer, Mercury's tail is very hard to see, which is why it went undiscovered until the 21st century. But Voltmer was able to photograph the giant plume thanks to a specialized filter that highlights yellow wavelengths of light, which are given off by the excited sodium particles in the tail. 

""Without such a filter, Mercury's tail is almost invisible to the naked eye,"" Voltmer told Spaceweather.com. 

Mercury is not the only celestial body in the solar system with a surprisingly comet-like tail. The moon also has a tail that is only visible once a month as Earth passes through it and wears it like a scarf. Like Mercury, the moon's tail is also predominantly made of millions of sodium atoms.

The second deepest blue hole in the world has been discovered off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The giant, underwater cavern, located in Chetumal Bay, is around 900 feet (274 meters) deep and spans an area of 147,000 square feet (13,660 square meters).  

That's just shy of the record set by the world's deepest known blue hole — the Dragon Hole in the South China Sea — which was discovered in 2016 and is thought to be more than 980 feet (300 m) deep.

Blue holes are large, undersea vertical caves or sinkholes found in coastal regions. Many contain a high diversity of plant and marine life, including corals, sea turtles and sharks. The one in Chetumal, named Taam Ja’ which means ""deep water"" in Mayan, has steep sides with slopes of almost 80 degrees, and the mouth of the cavern sits around 15 feet (4.6 m) below sea level. Scientists from El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (Ecosur), a public research center coordinated by Mexico's National Council of Science and Technology (Conacyt), first discovered it in 2021. A study of the find was published Feb. 23 in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science

Blue holes form when sea water meets limestone. Limestone is very porous, so water easily permeates the rock, enabling chemicals in the water to react with the limestone, eating it away. Many of the world's blue holes likely formed during past ice ages, when the repeated flooding and draining of coastal areas eroded the rock and created voids. When the last ice age ended around 11,000 years ago and sea levels rose, these caverns filled with water and some were completely immersed.

“They are largely poorly understood,” Christopher G. Smith
(opens in new tab)
, a coastal geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) who has studied other submarine sinkholes but was not involved in the latest research, told Live Science in an email. Smith added that the unique seawater chemistry in blue holes suggests they may interact with groundwater and possibly aquifers — bodies of rock or sediment that hold groundwater.

Blue holes contain little oxygen, and sunlight only shines on the surface. Despite these conditions, the gigantic voids are teeming with life that has adapted to the low-oxygen environment.

Blue holes may offer a snapshot of what life was like thousands of years ago. Without much oxygen or light, fossils can be well-preserved, enabling scientists to identify the remains of extinct species, the researchers noted in the study.

Blue holes may also tell us more about life on other planets. In 2012, researchers peering into blue holes in the Bahamas found bacteria deep in the caverns where no other lifeforms dwelled. Such findings could offer clues as to what life may exist in the extreme conditions elsewhere in our solar system.

Nature's captivating giants are on display on a scale like never before in ""Big Beasts,"" a brand new documentary series available to watch today on Apple TV+
(opens in new tab)
.

The 10-part spectacle will bring viewers up close and personal with the world's biggest, most astounding creatures. For a taste of what you can expect to see, Live Science has a short exclusive clip that will leave you wanting more.

The exclusive clip takes viewers on an immersive journey to underwater worlds. Get ready for a deep dive into the Pacific ocean, which contains over half of the water on Earth and is home to marine giants. The full episode promises to dazzle audiences with footage of the world's biggest fish, deadliest sharks and most enigmatic sea creatures.

The short teaser follows a whale shark before cutting to stunning footage of a sunfish and great white shark. It promises an encounter with a legendary sea monster whose tentacles you'll see pulsing as it hides away from sight.

""Being big comes with the most unexpected challenges and that's where we found some of our best material,"" executive producer and Emmy Award winner Tom Hugh-Jones
(opens in new tab)
 told Live Science. ""A lot of our stories are quite family-friendly — they're looking at what it's like to be a mom or a dad or a kid.""

Narrated by Marvel star and Emmy nominee Tom Hiddleston, the series will transport viewers across oceans and continents, from the freezing poles to tropical rainforests, to bring them face to face with the largest living animals.

""The most challenging part of filming 'Big Beasts' was capturing the world from giant animals' perspective,"" Hugh-Jones said. ""Giant animals are hard to get close to, sometimes dangerous to get close to, and we had to use all sorts of clever technology in order to put the cameras in unexpected angles.""

The series captures rare and astounding footage of more than 160 species in 17 different countries, including fan-favorites like orangutans, tigers and grizzly bears. ""My favorite moment is the grizzly bear fight,"" Hugh-Jones said. ""The crew came back with this fight between two big male bears, which I think was the most intense, aggressive and impressive fight that any of the wardens, and the scientists or the camera people had seen, and it all played out almost too close for comfort.""

Viewers can also expect poignant, jaw-dropping sequences featuring giant otters, gorillas and gray whales, all filmed using cutting-edge techniques and surprising angles to render the natural world in all its splendor.

""Filming animals in unfamiliar ways has really helped us get a new perspective of what life is like and how big animals face a bigger challenge,"" co-producer Bill Markham told Live Science. ""Spend some time with them and realize their challenges are the same as ours.""

""In the end, the biggest animals on this planet are a sign of how healthy our planet [is], and it's amazing that these animals still exist in a world that's changing so fast,"" Hugh-Jones said. ""I hope, in a soft way, that people will learn to admire and cherish them.""

Filmed over four and a half years, ""Big Beasts"" was produced by Plimsoll Productions with Tom Hugh-Jones and Emmy nominees Grant Mansfield and Martha Holmes executive producing. Big Beasts has ten episodes in total – the first four are available to stream now on Apple TV+, with two new episodes releasing each week up until May 19.

"20 days ago","Scientists invent 'shape-shifting' antibiotic to fight deadly superbugs","Scientists have developed a new ""shape-shifting"" antibiotic to fight drug-resistant bacteria, but it hasn't been tested in humans yet.","Scientists invented a new antibiotic that can shape-shift and kill drug-resistant bacteria in animal experiments. Here we see an illustration of Enterococci bacteria. (Image credit: SEBASTIAN KAULITZKI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)

The spread of drug-resistant ""superbugs"" — including bacteria that have evolved to thwart even the most potent antibiotics — represents an ever-growing threat to public health. Now, scientists have invented a new type of antibiotic that can take down these germs by rapidly rearranging its atoms and thus changing its shape.

The researchers described the first of these shape-shifting antibiotics in a paper published April 3 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
(opens in new tab)
. So far, they've tested the shape-shifter in wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larvae, a common animal model used to test antibiotics' effectiveness, but they've yet to give the drug to humans or other mammals.

To make the new antibiotic, the researchers used ""click chemistry"" — highly efficient chemical reactions that can quickly and reliably ""click"" different chemical building blocks together, like the two halves of a seat-belt buckle. The study's senior author, John Moses
(opens in new tab)
, a professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in New York, studied these ultrafast reactions under the guidance of K. Barry Sharpless, who earned one of his two Nobel Prizes for his role in the development of click chemistry.

""Click chemistry allows us to discover functional molecules quickly,"" Moses told Live Science in an email. 

The team's new antibiotic essentially clicks together an existing antibiotic called vancomycin with a molecule called bullvalene, whose atoms can easily swap positions and thus arrange themselves in more than a million possible configurations, according to a CSHL statement
(opens in new tab)
. This atom-juggling molecule served as the perfect core for the team's new antibiotic. Two vancomycin ""warheads"" are attached to this shape-shifting core, with one on each end.

Related: New discovery could help take down drug-resistant bacteria

Vancomycin
(opens in new tab)
 is a potent antibiotic used to treat serious ""gram-positive"" bacterial infections, meaning those caused by bacteria with a specific type of cell wall. To kill these germs, the drug binds to the bacterial cell wall and weakens it, causing the contents of the cell to leak out and the germ to die. 

Unfortunately, various bacteria have developed resistance to vancomycin. These resistant germs include vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), which in the U.S. caused an estimated 54,500 infections among hospitalized patients and 5,400 estimated deaths in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(opens in new tab)
.

In the new study, when the wax moth larvae were given no treatment, about 90% died within a week of being infected with VRE. When they were given a standard dose of vancomycin, the moths' one-week survival rate went from 10% to 40%. But when they were given the new shape-shifting drug, their survival rate jumped to 70%. For context, about 70% of healthy larvae given either drug survived to the seventh day. (Note that these moth larva studies reflect only the drugs' effectiveness in these organisms, not how safe or effective they would be in humans.)

Compared with normal vancomycin, the shape-shifting drug may have had more tools at its disposal to kill the bacteria, the team reported. ""We found that our shapeshifting compounds may have a new mode of action involving interaction with a key enzyme called MurJ,"" Moses said. This enzyme transports building materials from inside the cell to the cell wall, which helps the bacteria to multiply. ""This needs much more investigation to uncover the whole picture, but it is certainly an interesting observation,"" he said.

And notably, according to the team's analyses, the shape-shifting antibiotic didn't drive the VRE to become resistant to the drug — normally, exposure to an antibiotic pushes bacteria to pick up new resistance strategies, to enhance its survival. The team theorizes that, by frequently changing shape, the drug can find the optimal configuration to bind to the bacterial cell wall and thus trigger the most lethal effects without giving the bacteria a clear escape route by which to avoid the attack. But that's a hypothesis, for now.

""We currently do not know"" exactly how the new antibiotic overcomes resistance, Moses said. ""But one thing is for sure,"" he added, ""bacteria have not encountered shapeshifting drugs like these before, so that will create some level of chaos in the system.""

""This is an early-stage study, and we will be in for many surprises along the way"" as we continue to study and develop the drug, Moses concluded.

"21 days ago","Ancient princesses helped build vast warrior empire that prompted China to erect the Great Wall","Analysis of ancient DNA and grave goods from burials suggest that princesses helped to build a ""massive empire"" stretching from Kazakhstan to Mongolia.","An artist reconstruction of life among the Xiongnu imperial elite, who received rich burials in their multiethnic empire on the Mongolian steppe. (Image credit: DAIRYCULTURES Project)

Elite women, perhaps princesses, played a crucial role in holding the Xiongnu, one of the first nomadic empires of the eastern Eurasian Steppe, together, a new study suggests.

The Xiongnu, who may have been among the ancient ancestors of the Mongols, formed a confederation of nomadic peoples who controlled much of Central Asia, from present-day Kazakhstan to Mongolia, from about the second century B.C. until the first century A.D. 

But little is known about them, except for some Chinese records and recent genetic studies based on ancient DNA from their buried remains, said Bryan Miller
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan.

""This was an empire with extreme genetic diversity,"" he told Live Science. ""To call oneself Xiongnu at that time was to call oneself a participant in this massive empire.""

Miller is one of the lead authors of a new study exploring the genetics of remains found in Xiongnu graves in the foothills of the southern Altai Mountains, near what would have been the imperial frontier. The research was published in the journal Science Advances
(opens in new tab)
 on April 14.

Nomad princesses

DNA testing at two Xiongnu cemeteries showed that the people buried in the largest tombs were women who were closely related to people from the heartlands of the Xiongnu Empire — roughly in the middle of modern Mongolia — whose genetics were already known
(opens in new tab)
. 

The women were buried with rich grave goods, including ornamental gold disks, pieces of bronze chariots and horse gear. But the ancient DNA from the remains in the smaller tombs showed a much wider genetic diversity, suggesting those people often came from far-flung regions of the empire — from the Black Sea region to Eastern Mongolia, Miller said.

This finding suggests that the elite families who controlled the Xiongnu Empire probably sent their women to the frontiers in order to cement political alliances with local elites. Miller noted that the most special burials were given only to these elite women, who seem to have been involved in the politics of relatively remote regions.

""They are representatives of the imperial clan that ruled the empire,"" he said. ""You've got these marriage alliances spanning the whole empire, even in these local communities.""

Miller said these elite women maintained their high status throughout their lives, which was reflected in their special burials. That suggested they were active participants in the plan, and not just the tools of their male relatives. ""They really played an active role,"" he said. ""They were part of it.""

Ancient empire

The main source of information about the Xiongnu comes from Chinese records, who saw them as foreign enemies along China's northern and western borders.

Indeed, the name Xiongnu is thought to be a pejorative term, because its Chinese characters also spell ""fierce slave.""

Miller said that some of the earliest fortifications of what later became the Great Wall of China were built in an attempt to stop Xiongnu raids into Chinese lands. ""It was a way to control that very vibrant frontier,"" he said. 

Eventually, the Xiongnu were divided by civil wars. Some groups became tributaries of Chinese states, while some were conquered by other steppe peoples.

Archaeologist Ursula Brosseder
(opens in new tab)
 of the University of Bonn in Germany, who wasn't involved in the research, said the new study showed how the investigation of ancient DNA was moving away from the large-scale genetics of populations and toward the genetics of particular localities.

""The field of ancient genetics is now shifting,"" she told Live Science. ""So far, most of the studies we have seen concerned the genetics of population structures, such as when large migrations happened. But with this study, we've just zoomed into one society and used genetics as a tool to get a better understanding of how that society worked,"" she said.

"21 days ago","2,000-year-old hoard of Roman coins may have been hidden by a soldier during a bloody civil war in Italy","The silver coins, mainly from the first century B.C., were unearthed in Tuscany in Italy and are hidden relics from a turbulent time in Roman history.","The hoard of 175 silver Roman coins, worth tens of thousands of dollars in today's money in just face value alone, was found in 2021 near Livorno in Tuscany. (Image credit: Franco Sammartino)

A hoard of 175 silver coins unearthed in a forest in Italy may have been buried for safe keeping during a Roman civil war.

The coins seem to date from 82 B.C., the year the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla fought a bloody war across Italy against his enemies among the leaders of the Roman Republic, which resulted in Sulla's victory and his ascension as dictator of the Roman state.

The archaeologists who investigated the hoard of 175 silver Roman denarii — the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars in today's money — suggested it may have been buried by a Roman soldier who was then killed in battle.

But historian Federico Santangelo
(opens in new tab)
, a professor who heads Classics and Ancient History at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom, said it also could have been buried by a businessman who wanted to keep his money safe during turbulent times. ""I don't think we should trace this money to a soldier, although in principle it is possible,"" he told Live Science. Santangelo was not involved in the discovery.

The chronologies of such coin hoards show that many were buried during wars and upheavals. ""A number of people at times of crisis buried their stash of money and for whatever reason were prevented from retrieving it,"" Santangelo said.

Coin hoard

Researchers discovered the coin hoard buried in a terracotta pot in 2021 but kept it secret so that the site could be completely investigated.

Lorella Alderighi
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist with the provincial office for archaeology, told Live Science the coins were discovered by a member of an archaeological group in a newly-cut area of forest northeast of the city of Livorno in Tuscany. Archaeological investigations revealed the earliest coins dated from 157 or 156 B.C., while the most recent were from 83 or 82 B.C., she said.

The area was probably forested then as it is now, on a small hill overlooking a swamp. The remains of a Roman farm had previously been found about half a mile (1 kilometer) away, she said.

""The coins have definitely been hidden — they constituted a 'treasure' or piggy bank,"" she said. ""The easiest way to hide valuables was to bury them underground, away from homes where no one could find them.""

The coins were first spotted by a member of the Livorno Palaeontological Archaeological Group walking through a new forest cutting.  (Image credit: Lorella Alderighi)

But whoever buried the coins never returned to recover them; and Alderighi proposed that the owner may have been a Roman soldier caught up in the conflicts.

""These coins may have been the savings of a soldier returning home [during] military service,"" she said. ""He had hidden them because they constituted a useful sum, perhaps to buy and start his own farm.""

Several such coin hoards have been found in Italy; studies show many of them were buried at times of war or upheaval. Here we see over 100 found coins, all bagged and numbered. (Image credit: Pisa-Livorno Superintendency of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape)
Turbulent times

Alderighi noted that the hoard was buried during a troubled period in Italian history. 

A few years earlier, Italy had been gripped by the Social War between Rome and its Italian allies, while in 82 B.C. Sulla had just returned with his legions from Asia to confront his enemies in Rome, having already attacked the city in 88 B.C. and been declared a public enemy in 87 B.C.

""It was a very turbulent historical period,"" she said. ""Sulla's soldiers conquered territories as they advanced from south to north. But central Italy and Tuscany had not yet been conquered.""

Santangello added that Sulla's victory in late 82 B.C. was almost a ""blueprint"" for later Roman rulers. 

His victory was followed about 30 years later by a much larger Roman civil war between Julius Caesar and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, or Pompey the Great, who rose to power as a deputy to Sulla. And Caesar's victory in that war led directly to the rise to power of Augustus, the first Roman emperor, in 27 B.C.

""It became abundantly clear to everyone that whoever came out as the winner of the civil war would be — maybe not by law, but certainly in reality — the master of Rome,"" Santangello said.

Here's how to watch the stunning show.","Venus and the crescent moon are pictured on March 24, 2023 in Changchun, Jilin Province, China (Image credit: Qiu Chen/VCG via Getty Images)

Stargazers are set for a spectacular show this Saturday (April 22), as the moon and Venus ​ — the two brightest objects in the night sky — will appear as if they are about to collide amid a meteor shower, all while set against the backdrop of a stunning star cluster. 

Venus will appear 6 degrees above and to the left of the waxing crescent moon by Saturday, with the Pleiades star cluster — a group of seven visible (and many more dim) stars popularly known as the ""Seven Sisters"" — about the same apparent distance below a beautiful and slender crescent moon, according to NASA
(opens in new tab)
. 

As if that weren't enough of a sight, the sky will also be flecked with ""shooting stars"" from the Lyrid meteor shower, which will peak Saturday evening to Sunday morning. The Lyrids are  best witnessed in a dark, clear location. Weather permitting, as many as 18 meteor streaks per hour may be visible during this window, according to the American Meteor Society

RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...

For weeks, the moon and Venus have been inching toward the point where they appear closest to each other in Earth's sky, known as a conjunction. This phenomenon, which occurs once every few months between the moon and the other planets in the solar system, is a trick of perspective from our 2D view of the night sky. The moon and Venus are, of course, actually millions of miles apart, and the Pleiades are even farther away, at 444 light-years from Earth. 

You won't need a telescope or binoculars to see any of the cast in this cosmic drama, although viewing equipment will give you significantly more detail than the naked eye. If you want to use equipment to watch the show, see our recommendations for the best binoculars for stargazing.

With or without binoculars, catching the conjunction requires looking low along the western horizon just after sunset to see the crescent moon and the sparkling Pleiades hang below the brilliant Venus. On the darkened limb of the crescent moon, you should also see a glint, which has been reflected from Earth onto the moon and is known as Earthshine. If the sky is clear, flecks of fireballs from the Lyrid meteor shower will be visible.

Meteor showers occur when debris from a comet's tail vaporizes high up in Earth's atmosphere, making the dust and ice shed from the comet appear as a glowing trail of heated atmospheric gas. The burning sky furrows made by the Lyrids — one of the oldest known meteor showers and first discovered in China around 687 B.C. — are fragments from Comet Thatcher.

Streaming particles of space debris from Comet Thatcher have been visible from Earth for more than 2,600 years and strike our planet every April at speeds of around 29 miles per second (47 kilometers per second) as Earth's orbit takes us through Thatcher's debris tail, according to NASA
(opens in new tab)
. Thatcher is traveling slowly around the sun, making a complete orbit once every 415 years.

In the background hang the Pleiades, named after the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione in Greek mythology. According to myth, Atlas — one of the Titans and a cousin of Zeus, the king of the gods — rebelled against Zeus and was punished by being forced to forever bear the heavens on his broad shoulders. To ameliorate his cousin's eternal sentence, Zeus placed Atlas' grieving daughters in the heavens so that they could accompany their father.

If you can't catch Saturday's spectacle from your location, you can watch a livestream of the conjunction, as seen from Rome, courtesy of the Virtual Telescope Project

Save big on the MacBook Pro M2 at B&H Photo and Amazon right now - great deals for students and creatives.

The MacBook Pro now comes in three different sizes, with the 14-inch and 16-inch among the best laptops for coding you can buy today. This time around, we're focused on the smaller 13-inch model. While it can still do plenty of heavy lifting with programming, It's also one of the best laptops for students - and its secret weapon is its battery life.

Imagine our surprise, then, when we spotted this addition to our student laptop deals lineup.

Right now you can pick up the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the latest M2 processor for $1099
(opens in new tab)
 - that's 15% (or $200) off the MSRP. You can find the deal in question at B&H Photo, while Amazon has the 512GB version at $150

Let's get the negative out of the way first - yes, the M2 MacBook Pro 13-inch looks more than a little dated. It has thick bezels around the display, and it's a little chunkier than the latest M2 MacBook Air while offering the same processor.

It's still plenty portable, though, and while Apple's Touch Bar was much maligned when it debuted, with third-party tools it becomes an exceptionally powerful tool and is something you won't find on any of the company's other laptops.

The M2 processor is, as you'd expect, powerful, but the M2 MacBook Pro 13-inch is the best example of just how power efficient it is, too. Looking to carry it between lectures and still have some power left? Good news - it lasts for over 18 hours on a single charge. The closest alternative? The same laptop's M1 configuration peaks at around 16 hours.

"21 days ago","Gigantic, 13-foot crocodile found with its head torn off on Australian beach","The beheading, which may have been motivated by a recent spate of crocodile attacks on humans, could spell trouble for the local ecosystem.","The decapitated crocodile was found on Cow Bay Beach, north of the Daintree River in Queensland, Australia.  (Image credit: Tom Chalmers Hayes via Instagram (Screenshot from @crocodile_beers))

An idyllic beach in Australia turned into a nightmare scene earlier this week, when locals discovered an enormous, beheaded crocodile rotting in the sand.

Some residents think the mutilation could have been an act of vengeance following a recent spate of crocodile attacks against humans along the Queensland coast between Port Douglas and Cooktown, according to news.com.au
(opens in new tab)
. But it's still unclear how the 13-foot-long (4 meters; including the head) giant died, according to the Queensland Department for Environment and Science (DES).

The carcass was in such a state of decay that staff were unable to conduct a necropsy, the government agency said. ""Due to the state of decomposition, it cannot be determined if there has been any human interference,"" the DES told Live Science in a prepared statement. ""It may be that the crocodile was decapitated (pre- or post-mortem) due to natural predation.""

Some locals, however, doubt that another crocodile decapitated the enormous animal and suspect that it was slaughtered in a trophy killing.

""The DES claim is absolutely ridiculous,"" Tom Chalmers Hayes, a crocodile photographer and conservationist who went to the scene following reports of the dead animal, told Live Science in a message on social media. ""I was with the body for three hours and there is absolutely no marking to suggest a crocodile has killed this male and torn it up, very clear machete marks are on the body and around the neck area where the head has been removed.""

Related: Giant 14-foot-long crocodile found with human remains in stomach 

The headless crocodile was found on Cow Bay Beach, north of the Daintree River. Based on its size, the large male is considered an ""icon"" crocodile under Queensland's conservation laws, which means that it is more strictly protected than smaller individuals. Herpetologists estimate it was at least 30 to 40 years old and a top predator.

The loss of a gigantic male like this one could unsettle the social order of other crocodiles in the area. ""As we're only beginning to understand the social system of crocodiles, it is difficult to predict how the removal of a single large male crocodile will impact the remaining crocodiles in the area,"" Cameron Baker
(opens in new tab)
, a postdoctoral researcher at Charles Darwin University in Australia who is not involved in the beheading investigation, told Live Science in an email. ""However, it will likely represent a period of social unrest and change in the population as individuals try to determine where they sit in the new social hierarchy resulting from this large male's loss.""

Conflict could arise between several males vying to replace the dead individual, although crocodiles may not be as territorial as scientists once thought, Baker said.

There have been several serious but non-fatal crocodile attacks against humans in the area since February, which may have motivated the brutal beheading.  (Image credit: Shutterstock)

 —No one knows why decapitated sea lions keep turning up in Vancouver Island 

—Jurassic crocodile relative could breathe easily while drowning its prey 

The killing could also have a ripple effect on the coastal ecosystem. ""As top predators, crocodiles potentially play several crucial roles in their environment,"" Baker explained. ""For instance, by limiting the population density and behavior of their prey species, crocodiles inadvertently enhance the survival of their prey's prey. As such, the removal of crocodiles through hunting may unintentionally alter the composition of the ecosystem, reducing its overall health and productivity.""

Crocodiles in Queensland have come back from the brink of extinction since the 1970s, when hunters killed them for their skins, according to a 2020 DES report
(opens in new tab)
. But they are still listed as a vulnerable species by the DES under the state's Nature Conservation Act 1992
(opens in new tab)
.

The beheading follows three serious but non-fatal crocodile attacks on people in the area since February. The last incident occurred on April 8, when a nearly 15-foot-long (4.5 m) croc repeatedly bit a man and nearly drowned him at Archer Point, south of Cooktown. The man managed to escape by sticking his fingers in the animal's eyes.

(Image credit: The Trustees of the British Museum)

For thousands of years, six ancient Egyptian coffins have been sealed to the outside world, their contents unknown. Now, scientists have used technology to peer inside the coffins, which are now housed at the British Museum in London, for the first time since their burial, revealing the mummified remains of several animals, including a complete lizard skull.

The coffins, which range in length from approximately 2 inches (50 millimeters) to 12 inches (300 mm) and date to between 664 B.C. and 250 B.C, were unearthed in the ancient cities of Naukratis (also spelled Naucratis) and Tell el-Yehudiyeh (or Tell el-Yehudiya) in 1885. They were constructed using copper compounds and feature figures of lizards, eels and cobras on their exteriors. (The provenance of two of the coffins is unknown.) 

One of the boxes is topped with a human-headed part-eel, part-cobra creature wearing a crown that may be associated with Atum, an ancient Egyptian primordial god. The ornate imagery hints at the boxes' contents, which were revealed in a study published Thursday (April 20) in the journal Scientific Reports

Because the coffins were constructed of metal, scientists used a method called neutron tomography — a noninvasive technology that, unlike X-rays, isn't affected by metal — to look inside the coffins for the first time since their burial.

Inside one coffin, the scans revealed the complete intact skull of a lizard ""similar to a group of wall lizards"" whose species are found in North Africa to this day. Two other coffins contained fragments of animal bones wrapped in cloth, possibly linen, according to a statement. 

""While animal burials were commonplace in ancient Egypt, it's quite rare to have coffins that are still sealed,"" lead author Daniel O'Flynn
(opens in new tab)
, an X-ray imaging scientist at the British Museum, told Live Science. ""Because these boxes are made out of metal, it's very difficult to look through them with X-rays, so what we were able to do with this study was to look inside a small group of coffins using neutrons. This is the first time that we've been able to confirm for these objects at the British Museum that there are actually animal remains inside of them.""

In addition to the bones, scientists discovered lead in three of the coffins; the metal may have been used to distribute weight during the burial process or to fix a hole in the side of one of the coffins. The exteriors of several of the boxes were also affixed with loops, which could've been used to suspend them from shrine or temple walls or to carry them during religious processions, according to the statement.

—Ice Age mammoth, woolly rhino and hyena bones uncovered in English town

""The lead was an interesting finding,"" O'Flynn said. ""We found quite a lot of lead in three of the boxes. We're not entirely sure of its purposes. It could've been something purely practical. But another interpretation is that it could've been included due to its status in ancient Egypt as a magical material, and we know from previous research that lead was used in the protection of mummified remains as well as in love charms and curses.""

The study was inconclusive about whether the animals were sacrificed.

""It's possible that they were sacrificed, but they could also represent offerings to the gods,"" O'Flynn said.

"21 days ago","Worms and humans both get 'the munchies,' despite 500 million years of evolutionary separation","Researchers found that roundworms gobble down high-calorie foods when exposed to a compound that acts on the same brain receptor as THC.","This worm has been genetically engineered so that certain neurons and muscles are fluorescent.

Just like humans, roundworms may also crave their favorite snacks after getting high on weed, scientists recently discovered. The researchers didn't test the worm's reactions to cannabis itself, but to a compound that activates the same receptors in the brain.  

""The nematodes not only get the munchies, but they get them through the same process as mammals,"" Shawn Lockery
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of biology at University of Oregon, told Live Science. ""The effects of cannabinoids in nematodes parallel the effects of marijuana on human appetites.""

One of the most well-known effects of smoking or consuming marijuana is an intense increase in appetite, known as ""the munchies."" Marijuana, or the dried flowers, leaves, stems and seeds of the plant Cannabis sativa, contains a class of chemicals called cannabinoids. These cannabinoids include the main compound behind weed's psychoactive effects, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and they bind to cannabinoid receptors (CB) in the brain. In this way, these plant-made molecules mimic the action of molecules made by the human body, called endocannabinoids.

Endocannabinoids are known to regulate appetite and food intake, and in general, past studies have shown a strong link between CB receptor activation and hunger in humans and mammals. This activation induces cravings for food rich in sugars and fats. For example, rats high on THC eagerly gobble up chocolate cake batter
(opens in new tab)
 and drink copious amounts of sugar water
(opens in new tab)
, experiments have shown. However, the effects of cannabinoids on invertebrates, like nematodes, are poorly understood.

Related: How does cannabis get you high? 

In a study published Thursday (April 20) in the journal Current Biology
(opens in new tab)
, Lockery and his colleagues treated a species of roundworm called Caenorhabditis elegans to an endocannabinoid and studied their response to food. The roundworm feeds on bacteria in decaying plant matter and produces some of the same endocannabinoids seen in mammals, including anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). 

The scientists exposed worms to high concentrations of anandamide for 20 minutes and then offered them five types of bacteria. These bacteria differed in terms of how quickly they cause nematodes to grow, once eaten. The team found that the worms, now soaked in anandamide, rapidly devoured the growth-promoting bacteria while barely picking at the others. 

Next, the scientists placed the bacteria at different locations in a maze, into which they released the worms. Compared with their untreated peers, the anandamide-doped worms more often scrambled towards the arm that had growth-promoting bacteria and spent more time chowing down on the grub. These observations suggested that the endocannabinoid drove worms to not only prefer growth-promoting food, but also eat it quickly.

—Cannabis originated in China, genetic analysis reveals 

The researchers found that a specific worm cannabinoid receptor — NPR-19 — binds anandamide and seems to mediate this feeding frenzy. The team replaced the worm's gene for NPR-19 with the human gene for the CB1 receptor, the receptor that both anandamide and THC bind in people. They found that anandamide was still able to produce the munchies in the worm by binding to the human receptor.  

""The nematode and human cannabinoid receptors are interchangeable,"" Lockery said. ""This emphasizes the commonality of cannabinoid effects in nematodes and humans, even after 500 million years of evolution."" 

This shared experience of having the munchies not only connects nematodes and humans over evolutionary time, but also suggests that the endocannabinoid system likely serves similar functions in many animal species, and that those functions are key to those species' survival. Among these key functions are those involved in controlling food intake and specifically ""hedonic feeding,"" or cravings for tasty, calorie-dense foods.    

At least in nematodes, anandamide may trigger the munchies by making a specific class of smell-detecting, or olfactory neurons more sensitive to favored food odors and less sensitive to non-favored food odors, the team found. These neurons don't carry the NPR-19 receptor, so other neurons with the receptor are likely ""sending a message to the olfactory neurons,"" Lockery said. ""The next step is discovering the nature of this signal and the neurons sending it.""

(Image credit: SpaceX)

SpaceX's Starship — the largest and most powerful rocket ever built — has blasted off from its Texas launchpad. Despite exploding minutes after liftoff, the first-of-its-kind flight has been hailed as a success by the company. 

Starship launched from a SpaceX launchpad in Boca Chica, Texas, today (April 20) atop the company's Super Heavy booster rocket, whose 33 Raptor 2 engines carried the vehicle into the stratosphere with a record-breaking 16.5 million pounds (7.5 million kilograms) of thrust.

Shortly after liftoff, an issue with the separation mechanism between the rocket's two stages caused it to enter a spin, and it exploded just minutes later.

""As if the flight test was not exciting enough, Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly before stage separation,"" SpaceX wrote on Twitter
(opens in new tab)
.

The launch is the first test of the rocket system that SpaceX has said it will use to transport crews, spacecraft, satellites and cargo to locations in the solar system — both for its own purposes and on behalf of NASA. The U.S. space agency is slated to use Starship's Human Landing System to transport humans to the moon's surface for the first time since 1972 on the Artemis 3 and 4 missions. 

Now that the spaceship has shown it can take off, SpaceX intends to send another Starship into low Earth orbit with a crew on board by the end of the year, but how much the separation mechanism issue will delay or alter these plans is unknown. 

At 394 feet (120 meters) tall, Starship is roughly the length of three passenger jets and is 30 feet (10 m) taller than the Saturn V rocket that first sent the Apollo 11 astronauts to the moon in 1969. Starship is also more than twice as powerful as Saturn V, which propelled itself with 7.6 million pounds (3.4 million kg) of thrust.

Starship is designed primarily with cheap and efficient manufacturing in mind, using inexpensive stainless steel for its construction and methane (which SpaceX says can be collected on Mars) to power the rocket. It is designed to be reusable, and can carry a payload of up to 275 tons (250 metric tons) in its non-reusable state — around 10 times that of SpaceX's current Falcon 9 rockets.

This was the rocket's second attempt at taking off. During the first attempt, on Monday (April 17), the rocket was fueled and readied, but the launch was stopped with nine minutes left on the clock, after a frozen valve caused pressurization problems in the Super Heavy booster.

On Sunday (April 16), Musk lowered expectations for the upcoming launch, warning in a Twitter discussion that many problems could arise and that he would consider it a success if the launch just didn't ""blow up the launchpad.""

""Success is not what should be expected,"" he said ahead of Monday's scrubbed launch. ""It may take us a few kicks of the can here before we reach orbit.""

NASA has denied claims made by Kyiv’s city authorities that a mysterious, dazzling flash of light above Ukraine’s capital was caused by one of its defunct satellites tumbling to Earth.

The bright flash, which was seen over the city at around 10 p.m. local time (3 p.m. EDT), prompted the city’s authorities to turn on air raid alerts. Citing early data, Serhiy Popko, the head of the city’s military administration, said on Telegram that the ""phenomenon was the result of a Nasa space satellite falling to Earth.""

But NASA later refuted this, saying that at the time the flash occurred, its satellite — the dead, 660-pound (300 kilograms) Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite — was still in orbit.

“One more time: the bright flash seen over Kyiv has NOTHING TO DO with the reentry of NASA's RHESSI satellite, whose orbit doesn't come within thousands of kilometers of Ukraine,” Jonathan McDowell
(opens in new tab)
, an astronomer at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts, wrote on Twitter

.

NASA's most up-to-date prediction suggest the satellite hurtled through our atmosphere at 8:50 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, April 19 (12:50  a.m. UTC on Thursday, April 20), plus or minus 1 hour. The space agency hasn’t announced that the satellite has landed yet, or where. McDowell, who has been tracking the falling space junk, said that RHESSI’s possible debris field could fall over anywhere from southern South America, to northern Africa, Central Asia or China.

The mysterious flash above Kyiv has filled Ukrainian social media with popular memes and conspiracy theories — many speculating that aliens aboard UFOs were the cause of the light in the sky. It is not the first time mysterious objects have been seen over the country, but Ukraine’s space agency has said
(opens in new tab)
 (in Ukrainian) that the flash was likely from a meteorite exploding into a fireball as it entered Earth’s atmosphere.

RHESSI was launched into a low-Earth orbit by the Pegasus XL rocket in 2002. The satellite used a spectrometer that detected X-rays and gamma rays — high-energy waves from the sun that are largely blocked by Earth's atmosphere — to capture data on eruptions from the sun in the form of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

The satellite is just one of many potentially hazardous pieces of space junk that have made headlines after tumbling uncontrollably out of orbit. Four of China's Long March 5B boosters — the workhorses of the country's growing space program — fell to Earth between 2020 and 2022, raining debris down on the Ivory Coast, Borneo and the Indian Ocean. In 2021 and 2022, debris from falling SpaceX rockets smashed into a farm in Washington state and landed on a sheep farm in Australia. 

Space agencies around the world try to keep tabs on the more than 30,000 largest pieces of this junk, but many more pieces of debris are simply too small to monitor.

"21 days ago","'High Holiday' 420 has hazy origins","Though there are many urban legends out there, the origins of 4/20 as an international holiday to smoke marijuana are hazy.","April 20, or 4/20, may be the unofficial holiday for pot smokers, but its origins are particularly hazy. (Image credit: Eric Limon/Shutterstock)

Today is April 20 — or 4/20 for all the marijuana enthusiasts out there. It is the unofficial holiday for people who want to get high all over the world.

The day has become so inextricably linked with the herbal leaf that a Google search lists 420 as simply one of the date's holidays and observances (along with UN Chinese Language Day). But how exactly did the association between 420 and marijuana begin?

The story told on countless couches around the country is that ""420"" is police code for a marijuana arrest. But take a clear-eyed look at that explanation, and it goes up in smoke.

Arrest in progress myth

It turns out, the terminology that linked 4/20 with smoking pot took root in Northern California in the early 1970s, said Steve Bloom,
(opens in new tab)
 the publisher of CelebStoner and the founder of Freedom Leaf magazine.

Bloom, however first came upon the connection when he was given a flier at a Grateful Dead concert at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in 1990. The flier recounted the now-famous apocryphal tale that 420 was police code for a marijuana arrest in progress.

""The makers of the flier thought it was a good idea to turn that around and smoke on 4/20,"" Bloom told Live Science.

The flier urged its readers to celebrate 4/20 as ""the grandmaster of all holidays,"" when they should meet up with friends to smoke pot together at 4:20 p.m. on 4/20, Bloom said.

Bloom wrote about the flier in High Times magazine, and the idea soon took off, he said.

True origins of 420

But the police-origin story was off the mark, as that is not the code used for a marijuana bust.

""A few years later a few other people got in touch with High Times claiming they were the rightful owners of 420,"" Bloom said.

It turned out that a group of men who called themselves the Waldos went to high school in San Rafael in California during the 1970s, when the Grateful Dead lived there and the hippie culture reigned supreme. One day they heard a story from a friend about a patch of weed being grown by a U.S. Coast Guard member near the coastal town of Point Reyes. The Coast Guard member was too scared to go harvest it, so the Waldos decided to go on a treasure hunt for the marijuana patch. They decided to meet at a Louis Pasteur statue near campus at 4:20 p.m. to accommodate their school schedules, before heading off in search of the green gold, according to 420Waldos.com, a website set up by the high-school group of friends which now includes information on the holiday's origin.

The pot search routine went on for weeks and the group agreed to meet every day at ""420 Louis"" to continue the search. Though it wound up being a wild goose chase, it eventually gave rise to the shortened term ""420"" to denote smoking marijuana.

""We didn't know we were creating history at the time, it was just a private joke we were telling between ourselves,"" said Dave Reddix, one of the original waldos, who is now an independent filmmaker in San Francisco.

The Grateful Dead lived in San Rafael at the same time as the Waldos, and the group sometimes hung out in ""deadhead"" circles, even lingering backstage after shows. Gradually, their terminology spread through the Grateful Dead community into the wider stoner culture, Bloom said. 

The Waldos not only spoke with an editor at High Times (not Bloom) and signed statements attesting the truth of their story, but they also provided documents, such as old letters referring to marijuana by its numerical nickname, old high-school newspapers using the term, and even a ""420,"" batik-dyed marijuana flag, according to 420Waldos.com. Though they were initially anonymous, but in the late 1990s, a few of the original group have come forward with their real names. Recently, they even found the U.S. Coast Guard member, who is now homeless, and finally found the location of the original pot, Reddix said.

Wider cultural trend

People wait outside a Grateful Dead concert at the Oakland Arena on Dec. 12, 1992. Bloom first found a flyer describing the holiday ""420"" as a police arrest in progress at such a concert, but that urban myth had been circulating at least 15 years prior to the concert. (Image credit: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty)

But how exactly did the term make its way from a local term to a global holiday? The flier that Bloom and others received at the Oakland Grateful Dead concert may have been the catalyst that launched ""420"" from local Northern California underground slang to the central day for major marijuana celebrations and protests throughout the world.   But the false association between police busts and 420 predates the Grateful Dead concert by at least 15 years, said Steve Capper, one of the Waldos, who is now in the financial services industry in San Francisco.

""The first time I heard it, I was going to school in Southern California,"" somewhere between 1974 to 1975, Capper told Live Science. ""I'd fly back and would pass by a high-school kid hitchhiking.""

After picking them up, he would ask them if they knew what 420 was.

""They'd say 'it's a police code for marijuana,'"" Capper said.

The real turning point, however, was the Oakland concert, Bloom said.

""I was not the only person who got the flier, but was the one who was able to spread it out through the magazine,"" Bloom said. ""Over the years, it just kind of picked up steam. That was really what started to build up the 4/20 phenomenon.""

Exactly who created the flier, and launched 4/20 into a global day of celebration of all things cannabis, however, is still unknown.  

""The mysterious deadheads behind the flier are the ones who created the holiday,"" Bloom said. ""It's become the stoner high holiday, and these guys are the people who created it.""

The Vikings are remembered as fierce fighters, but even these mighty warriors were no match for climate change. Scientists recently found that ice sheet growth and sea level rise led to massive coastal flooding that inundated Norse farms and ultimately drove the Vikings out of Greenland in the 15th century.

The Vikings first established a foothold in southern Greenland around A.D. 985 with the arrival of Erik Thorvaldsson, also known as ""Erik the Red,"" a Norwegian-born explorer who sailed to Greenland after being exiled from Iceland. Other Viking settlers soon followed, forming communities in Eystribyggð (Eastern Settlement) and Vestribyggð (Western Settlement) that thrived for centuries. (At the time of the Vikings' arrival, Greenland was already inhabited by people of the Dorset Culture, an Indigenous group that preceded the arrival of the Inuit people in the Arctic, according to the University of California Riverside
(opens in new tab)
).

Around the 15th century, signs of Norse habitation in the region vanished from the archaeological record. Researchers previously suggested that factors such as climate change and economic shifts likely led the Vikings to abandon Greenland. Now, new findings show that rising seas played a key role, by submerging miles of coastline, according a new study published April 17 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Between the 14th and 19th centuries, Europe and North America experienced a period of significantly cooler temperatures, known as the Little Ice Age. Under these chilly conditions, the Greenland Ice Sheet — a vast blanket of ice covering most of Greenland — would have become even bigger, Marisa Julia Borreggine
(opens in new tab)
, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University, said when she presented data at an American Geophysical Union annual conference in New Orleans in December 2021.

As the ice sheet advanced, its increasing heaviness weighed down the substrate underneath, making coastal areas more prone to flooding, Borreggine said. At the same time, the increased gravitational attraction between the expanding ice sheet and large masses of sea ice pushed more seawater over Greenland's coast. These two processes could have driven widespread flooding along the coastline — ""exactly where the Vikings were settled,"" Borreggine said. 

The scientists tested their hypothesis by modeling estimated ice growth in southwestern Greenland over the 400-year period of Norse occupation and adding those calculations to a model showing sea level rise during that time. Then, they analyzed maps of known Viking sites to see how their findings lined up with archaeological evidence marking the end of a Viking presence in Greenland.

Their models showed that from about 1000 to 1400, rising seas around Greenland would have flooded Viking settlements by as much as 11 feet (3.3 meters), affecting about 78 square miles (204 square kilometers) of coastal land, Borreggine said. This flooding would have submerged land that the Vikings used for farming and as grazing pastures for their cattle, according to the models.

However, sea level rise was probably not the only reason the Vikings left Greenland. Other types of challenges can cause even long-standing communities to collapse, and a perfect storm of external pressures — such as climate change, social unrest and resource depletion — may have spurred the Vikings to abandon their settlements for good, Borreggine said. 

""A combination of climate and environmental change, the shifting resource landscape, the flux of supply and demand of exclusive products for the foreign market, and interactions with Inuit in the North all could have contributed to this out-migration,"" she said. ""Likely a combination of these factors led to the Norse migration out of Greenland and further west.""

Scientists recently boosted the resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to 64 million times higher than normal. They used the technique to take captivating, high-definition images of a mouse brain, showing the organ like never before. 

While the swirly, psychedelic images are that of a rodent's brain, the research team thinks humans could be next to undergo one of these newly enhanced brain scans. The technology could help doctors detect changes to the human brain that occur due to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as changes linked to healthy aging. 

The mouse scan was shared as part of a new paper published April 17 in the journal PNAS

""It is something that is truly enabling,"" lead author G. Allan Johnson

For four decades, Johnson, with the help of a revolving team of students and researchers from Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopy, has been working on improving MRI, which was invented by American physician Dr. Raymond Damadian
(opens in new tab)
 50 years ago. 

MRI uses powerful magnets to generate magnetic fields, which cause the hydrogen atoms within water molecules in the body to align their ""spins,"" or point in a specific direction. The machine then uses a pulse of radio waves to ""flip"" the atoms' spins. The atoms then fall back into alignment, and each flip generates a radio signal that can be detected by the MRI scanner and used to make an image.

To improve upon this technology, researchers created a souped-up MRI outfitted with a high-powered 9.4-tesla magnet. (For comparison, most MRIs are equipped with a 1.5- to 3-tesla magnet.) They also added gradient coils that are 100 times stronger than current models and are what create the images, as well as a high-speed computer that is as powerful as approximately 800 laptops, according to the statement. 

After scanning the mouse brain, the researchers sent tissue samples to be imaged using a technique called light sheet microscopy, which allowed them to label specific groups of cells in the brain that were then mapped onto the original MRI. These additional steps provided a colorful view of cells and circuits throughout the brain, according to the statement. 

The researchers took one set of MRI images that captured how the mouse's brain-wide connectivity evolved with age. A second group of images showcased brilliantly colored brain connections that highlighted the deterioration of neural networks in a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease, according to the statement.

By studying mouse models of human diseases like Alzheimer's, researchers can better understand how these conditions emerge and progress in humans. The technique could also be useful for studying how the brain changes when mice are put on specific diets or given drugs in an effort to extend their life spans, Johnson said in the statement. 

""The question is, is their brain still intact during this extended lifespan?"" he said. ""We have the capacity now to look at it. And as we do so, we can translate that directly into the human condition.""

"22 days ago","Dinosaur-killing asteroid did not trigger a long 'nuclear winter' after all","Global temperatures did not plummet in the aftermath of the asteroid impact that caused the demise of the dinosaurs, a new study suggests.","There was no long-lasting impact winter after the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs hit Earth, a new study reveals. (Image credit: Mark Garlick via Getty Images)

The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs did not trigger a long-lasting impact winter, scientists have found — a discovery that raises new questions about what happened on Earth just after it hit. 

One spring day 66 million years ago, a 6-mile-wide (10 kilometers) asteroid smashed into the Yucatán Peninsula and upended life on Earth. This event, called the Chicxulub impact, triggered a mass extinction that wiped out 75% of species, including all non-avian dinosaurs. 

But how exactly it killed the dinosaurs is a bit of a mystery — after all, they weren't congregated beneath the asteroid, waiting to be squashed. For decades, scientists speculated that the impact tossed so much dust and dirt into the atmosphere that it triggered an ""impact winter"" (similar to a nuclear winter) — a period of prolonged cooling during which global temperatures plummeted.

However, a study published March 22 in the journal Geology
(opens in new tab)
 tells a different story.

Related: Largest asteroid ever to hit Earth was twice as big as the rock that killed off the dinosaurs

""We found that there was no evidence for the 'nuclear winter,'"" Lauren O'Connor
(opens in new tab)
, a geoscientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and first author of the study, told Live Science in an email. ""At least, not in the resolution of our study,"" which would have detected temperature declines spanning 1,000 years or more. 

O'Connor and her team analyzed bacteria fossilized in coal samples from before, during, and after the Chicxulub impact. In response to temperature changes, these bacteria thicken or thin their cell walls ""like putting a blanket on or taking one off,"" she said. 

The researchers found that in the millennia after the impact, the bacteria didn't seem to be bulking up for winter. Instead, they found a roughly 5,000 year warming trend that stabilized relatively quickly. These hot years may have been the result of super volcanoes belching CO2 into the atmosphere in the millennia leading up to the Cretaceous period's abrupt end.

This doesn't mean that an impact winter is off the table altogether, Sean Gulick
(opens in new tab)
, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the study, told Live Science. The blanket of dust kicked up by the asteroid may have only lingered in the atmosphere for a decade or less — not noticeably changing global temperatures, but plunging Earth into darkness. ""It doesn't even need to be that long,"" said Gulick. ""If you just had months without the sun, it would be enough to kill most of the plants in the world.""

With so many plants gone, herbivores would have struggled to find enough food to eat. As these species died, it would have sent shockwaves up the food chain, killing off large carnivores and other species that depended on them. This event, while devastating, would have been a blip in the fossil record. ""It's really, really fast geologically,"" Gulick said.

O'Connor's team agreed that there likely was a short period of cold and darkness at the start of the end-Cretaceous extinction. But it doesn't seem to have set off a long-term cooling trend.

Their findings indicate that Earth may be capable of rebounding from a climate-changing event faster than previously thought — but not without triggering a mass extinction, O'Connor said.

The researchers now plan to investigate coal from more sites in the U.S. in order to piece together a record of temperature changes in the millennia leading up to the asteroid impact. They hope these data will help them disentangle the effects of volcanism from the Chicxulub impact, and that the parallels to volcanic warming give us a clearer idea of what to expect in our current climate crisis.

A defunct, 660-pound (300 kilograms) NASA satellite is set to tumble uncontrollably back to Earth after spending two decades studying the sun from our orbit. 

NASA's Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite will hurtle through the Earth's atmosphere at 9:30 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, April 19 (1:30  a.m. UTC on Thursday, April 20), plus or minus 16 hours, NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense said. 

The bulk of the dead satellite — which examined solar eruptions from 2002 until it was decommissioned in 2018 — is expected to burn up while passing through our atmosphere. NASA has said it is not disclosing where the surviving debris will land.

""The risk of harm coming to anyone on Earth is low — approximately 1 in 2,467,"" NASA officials wrote in a blog post on Monday (April 17).

RHESSI was launched into a low-Earth orbit by the Pegasus XL rocket in 2002. The satellite used a spectrometer that detected X-rays and gamma rays — high-energy waves from the sun that are largely blocked by Earth's atmosphere —  to capture data on eruptions from the sun in the form of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). 

By observing more than 100,000 X-ray flashes, RHESSI documented solar flares ranging from miniscule nanoflares to gigantic superflares and even made improved measurements of the sun's shape.

The satellite is just one of many potentially hazardous pieces of space junk that have made headlines after tumbling uncontrollably out of orbit. Four of China's Long March 5B boosters — the workhorses of the country's growing space program — fell to Earth between 2020 and 2022, raining debris down on the Ivory Coast, Borneo and the Indian Ocean. In 2021 and 2022, debris from falling SpaceX rockets smashed into a farm in Washington state and landed on a sheep farm in Australia. 

Space agencies around the world try to keep tabs on the more than 30,000 largest pieces of this junk, but many more pieces of debris are simply too small to monitor.

Space junk isn't just a problem when it falls on us, either. Researchers have found that the more than 9,300 tons (8,440 metric tons) of space objects orbiting Earth — including inoperative satellites and chunks of spent rocket stages — increase the overall brightness of the night sky by more than 10% over large parts of the planet, creating ambient light pollution that makes distant space phenomena harder to detect. These objects also pose a threat to the International Space Station and other spacecraft carrying humans.

Scientists have proposed multiple ways of tidying Earth's skies, such as gathering junk up in nets; collecting it with clawed robots; or firing a half–mile-long (0.8 km) tether from another spacecraft to grab it. On April 11, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced it will set up a space bureau responsible for managing orbital trash, as well as modernizing regulations on the space industry.

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

Scientists have discovered never-before-seen viruses that thrive in sunlit oceans from pole to pole and infect plankton. They dubbed the newfound microbes ""mirusviruses"" — ""mirus"" meaning ""strange"" in Latin.

The researchers concluded that mirusviruses belong to a large group of viruses called Duplodnaviria, which includes the herpesviruses that infect animals and humans, based on shared genes that encode the shell, or ""particle"" enclosing their DNA. But the strange, newfound viruses also share a staggering number of genes with a group of giant viruses, called Varidnaviria.

This suggests that mirusviruses are a bizarre hybrid between two distantly related viral lineages, the scientists concluded.

""They seem to be an extremely unusual group of viruses,"" Tom Delmont
(opens in new tab)
, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) who participated in the discovery, told Live Science. ""This is why we consider them as being chimeric, because they are a mix of two different groups of viruses — on one side the herpesviruses, based on the particle genes, and on the other side the giant viruses, based on many more genes.""

The team described the strange, newfound viruses in a study published Wednesday (April 19) in the journal Nature
(opens in new tab)
. The discovery highlights how little we know about the viruses lurking in Earth's oceans.

Related: Scientists discover viruses that secretly rule the world's oceans

To find the viruses, the team pored over data from the Tara Ocean expedition
(opens in new tab)
, which collected nearly 35,000 ocean water samples containing viruses, algae and plankton between 2009 and 2013. The researchers then searched for evolutionary clues in millions of microbes' genes.

""Working on this data is like surveying a huge area of sand with a metal detector, looking for a treasure,"" Delmont said. ""We found an evolutionary treasure.""

In combing through this data trove, the scientists detected a previously undescribed lineage of double-stranded DNA viruses, the mirusviruses, that can be found in the sunlit surface waters of polar, temperate and tropical oceans. These abundant viruses infect plankton, which are tiny organisms that drift on ocean currents and can produce spectacular blooms visible from space, according to the National Ocean Service
(opens in new tab)
. 

By invading the plankton's cells, mirusviruses likely help regulate the microorganisms' activity and thus the flow of carbon and nutrients through the ocean.

""Viruses are a very natural component of plankton at the surface of the ocean,"" Delmont said. ""They are going to destroy many, many cells every day and this is going to release nutrients, particles inside the cells that are going to be used by other cells to be active and healthy.""

Mirusviruses may be the key to resolving the enigmatic origin of herpes viruses, Delmont said. The genes encoding the protective shell around viral DNA are strikingly similar in both groups, suggesting that they are related.

""This means that there is a shared evolutionary history between herpes, that infect only animals, and the mirusviruses that are everywhere in the ocean, where they infect unicellular organisms,"" Delmont said. ""All of this is pointing to a planktonic origin for herpes.""

(Image credit: Lloyd Edwards/Raggy Charters)

Newlyweds were treated to an incredibly rare sight on their wedding day when the whale-watching vessel they were aboard encountered an albino dolphin calf — likely the first of its kind seen in Africa. 

The lucky couple, along with their family and friends, saw the unusually colored cetacean April 4 onboard a Raggy Charters
(opens in new tab)
 vessel in Algoa Bay, a marine wildlife hotspot in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. Lloyd Edwards, boat captain and owner of Raggy Charters, was the first to spot the ghostly creature among a large pod of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus).

""All of a sudden, I saw a white flash in the water among a pod of around 200 dolphins,"" Edwards wrote on Facebook
(opens in new tab)
. ""When I saw it again, there it was, a beautiful [albino] calf."" It is the first recorded sighting of an albino bottlenose dolphin in Africa, he added.

The calf, which is likely around a month old and measures around 3.3 feet (1 meter) long, is most likely a true albino, but this is hard to tell from pictures alone, experts told Live Science.

Albinism is a genetic condition that prevents animals from producing the pigment melanin, which gives color to their skin, fur, feathers and eyes. As a result, albino animals appear white in color and have pink eyes — both of which are more susceptible to light than normal. Albinism can often be confused with leucism, a condition that prevents individual cells from producing melanin. Leucistic animals can either be completely white, a dull yellow color or have patches of both mixed with their normal coloration. To a casual observer, it can be hard to tell the difference between the two conditions.

The dolphin's solid white coloration hints that it is a true albino, rather than being leucistic, Erich Hoyt, a research fellow at Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) in the U.K. and author of the ""Encyclopedia of Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises
(opens in new tab)
,"" (Firefly Books, 2017) told Live Science in an email. 

The fact that you can't see the color of the dolphin's eyes makes it harder to tell for certain if it is an albino, Hoyt said. However, it is possible that the individual's eyes are closed because their eyes are unusually sensitive to light, he added. But genetic testing is the only way to say for sure, Hoyt said.

For some animals, being albino can greatly decrease their chances of survival, which is why albinism remains very rare in the wild and more common in zoos and aquariums. But for this individual, that may not be the case.

""I would say there’s a good chance this albino will survive to adulthood,"" if it survives the next few months, Hoyt said. ""Albinos in most species are at risk as they stand out [to predators], he added, ""but the potential predators of bottlenose dolphins are very few and colour would not make a difference to potential predators,"" such as orcas or large sharks.

—Extremely rare white humpback whale washes up dead on Australian beach

The calf's poor vision also shouldn't impact it in later life as dolphins use sound to communicate and hunt, Hoyt said. This individual will also likely be able to have normal-colored calves in the future unless its partner also possesses albino genes, he added. (Albinism is a recessive trait, meaning both parents must have a copy of the albino gene for their offspring to demonstrate the trait.)

This is not the first time that a young albino dolphin has been spotted. In June 2017, a 3-year-old albino Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) was spotted swimming with its mom in California's Monterey Bay. This individual was also in good health and had great chances of survival, experts told Live Science at the time.

The annual Lyrid meteor shower will peak this weekend, and the mostly moonless skies will make it a great time to spot fireballs, bright meteors visible for a few seconds. 

The second meteor shower of 2023 after January's Quadrantids, the Lyrids are expected to peak at 9:04 p.m. EDT on Saturday (April 22) (0106 GMT on Sunday, April 23), according to EarthSky
(opens in new tab)
. At that time, Lyra, the constellation the Lyrids appear to come from, will be highest in the night sky as seen from Europe and Africa. 

That peak occurs at 9:06 EDT, so viewers in North America should be on the lookout anytime after dark on Saturday, though more ""shooting stars"" may be observed closer to midnight as Lyra rises higher into the night sky. They can be seen anywhere in the night sky.

However, no matter where you're located, it will be worth looking for meteors immediately after sunset on Saturday, to glimpse another splendid sight: the slim crescent moon hanging just below the bright planet Venus in the west.

Around 18 ""shooting stars"" per hour are expected during the peak, each with a velocity of around 29 miles per second (47 kilometers per second), according to the American Meteor Society
(opens in new tab)
, which calls the Lyrids a medium-strength shower that can produce fireballs. Fireballs are caused by meteoroids the size of large marbles, according to the Natural History Museum

The Lyrids have been observed for at least 2,700 years, according to NASA

(Image credit: Gresky, J. et al. Nature (2023); (CC-BY 4.0))

In a gruesome exchange about 3,600 years ago, the severed right hands of at least 12 individuals were traded for gold and then buried in a royal palace in ancient Egypt, a new study finds. 

Scientists discovered the severed hands buried in three pits during a 2011 excavation of a courtyard in the palace, located in an ancient city of Avaris (modern-day Tell el-Dab'a) in northern Egypt's eastern Nile delta region. In the new study, researchers suggest that at least 11 of the hands belonged to males, but that the sex of the 12th individual is uncertain, meaning that it could have belonged to a female. 

The hand bones showed no signs of age-related degeneration: Rather, these remains likely belonged to adults older than 14 to 21 years old, the team reported in the study, published March 31 in the journal Nature

At the time the hands were deposited, the Hyksos, a group of people who originated from Asia, controlled part of Egypt and ruled during the 15th dynasty (circa 1640 B.C. to 1530 B.C.) from Avaris. 

The severed hands are the earliest known physical evidence of a practice known as the ""gold of honor,"" the researchers said. This ceremony, which is described in ancient Egyptian records, involved warriors bringing the severed right hands of enemies in exchange for a rich reward of a collar of gold beads. 

Enemies who met this fate were usually men of fighting age, but the presence of a possible female hand is not a surprise, the researchers noted. ""Women and warfare did not exist in separate worlds,"" the team wrote in the study. ""On the contrary, they were inextricably linked to the political, social and religious spheres. Consequently, we cannot exclude that the specific hand attested at Tell el-Dab'a belonged to a woman.""

These severed remains were likely seen as trophies and handed over during a public event at the palace, the researchers said. They theorized that the Hyksos may have introduced the practice to Egypt and that other Egyptian rulers later adopted it. There are no Egyptian records of this practice occurring prior to the Hyksos period, the researchers noted in the paper.

Whose hands were severed? 

It's unclear if the hands were severed from living or dead victims, but the acts themselves likely occurred within or near Avaris. It is ""rather likely that the hands were taken close to Avaris as they were intact when they were buried and most probably not mummified,"" study lead author Julia Gresky
(opens in new tab)
, a scientist at the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin, told Live Science in an email. 

The Hyksos were pushed out of Egypt by forces led by the pharaoh Ahmose around 1550 B.C. But it's unknown if the severed hands came from Egyptian warriors who the Hyksos were fighting, as none of the ancient DNA was preserved in the severed bones, Gresky said. 

Anna-Latifa Mourad-Cizek, an honorary research fellow at Macquarie University in Australia who was not involved in the study, praised the discovery. ""This is a remarkable find that adds critical information to our understanding of the practices of the inhabitants of Avaris,"" Mourad-Cizek told Live Science in an email.

Sonia Zakrzewski
(opens in new tab)
, a professor of bioarchaeology and bioanthropology at the University of Southampton in the U.K. who was not involved in the research, agreed that the hands were likely offered for the gold of honor. 

But she disagreed with the method the team used to determine the sex of the individuals. Because the team was unable to get DNA samples from the hand bones, they calculated the ratio of the second digit to the fourth digit of the hands. The fourth digit is usually longer than the second digit in men, the team noted. Zakrzewski disagrees with the accuracy of this method, noting that women can also have a longer fourth digit. 

""I think it's a wonderful find and a great paper, even if I am unconvinced by the certainty of their sexing of the hands,"" Zakrzewski said.

(Image credit: Todd Salat/AuroraHunter.com)

An ethereal whirlpool of light recently appeared in the night sky above Alaska, briefly stealing the limelight from a strong auroral display. But the bizarre, spiral-shaped object had nothing to do with the dancing polar lights. 

Instead, the luminous vortex was just the latest example of what astronomers have nicknamed ""SpaceX spirals,"" which are becoming an increasingly common sight for stargazers across the globe. These spirals form when rocket fuel, which is ejected from the fast-spinning upper stages of Falcon 9 rockets, gets frozen in space. These frozen swirls then reflect sunlight back towards Earth, which makes them visible to stunned onlookers on the ground.

The spiral was spotted in the sky above Alaska on April 15 at around midnight local time, while vibrant green Northern Lights were already dancing across the night sky, Spaceweather.com
(opens in new tab)
 reported. The strange whirlpool was was filmed by cameras at the University of Alaska's Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks.

The video shows the spiral forming from an initial bright spot into a massive galaxy-shaped object, before gradually fading into nothingness. It was visible for around seven minutes.    

""I was utterly surprised and mystified when I first spotted a distant bright light coming toward me from the northern horizon,"" Todd Salat
(opens in new tab)
, an astrophotographer who captured an image
(opens in new tab)
 of the spiral above Donnelly Dome near Delta Junction, told Spaceweather.com. ""At first I thought it was a jet airliner flying through some clouds. Then it took on the spiral shape and grew big fast!"" 

Related: Eerie ring of red light flashes like a massive UFO above Italy. What was it?

The spiral was made up of fuel ejected by a Falcon 9 rocket that launched from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base around three hours before the whirlpool appeared. The rocket successfully deployed 51 satellites into Earth-orbit, bolstering both SpaceX's own Starlink constellation and satellite networks belonging to other private companies, SpaceNews
(opens in new tab)
 reported.

Not every SpaceX rocket launch leads to a SpaceX spiral. Many occur above the vast, empty expanse of the Pacific Ocean, or during the day when they are not visible at all. However, the spirals have become more common in recent years as the number of SpaceX launches has increased

On Jan. 18, an eerily-perfect spiral was filmed above Hawaii by the Subaru-Asahi Star Camera, mounted on Mauna Kea and operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. The same camera  also spied another striking spiral in April 2022.

But SpaceX is not the only cause of these rocket-derived light shows.

In April 2022, frozen fuel from a Chinese rocket created a spinning orb of light that also photobombed an auroral display above Alaska. And in October 2017, an even larger blue orb was seen in the sky above Siberia, according to ScienceAlert
(opens in new tab)
. On that occasion, the frozen fuel was left by Russian military rocket tests in the area.

"23 days ago","Colossal iceberg trapped near Antarctica's 'Doomsday Glacier' for 20 years is finally on the move","Iceberg B-22A, which first broke off from Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier in 2002, is finally moving away from the South Pole after being freed from its seafloor tether.","An aerial image of B-22A captured by NASA's Terra satellite on Feb. 2, 2022.  (Image credit: NASA/MODIS/Terra satellite)

An enormous iceberg that first broke off Antarctica's ""Doomsday Glacier"" more than 20 years ago is finally waving goodbye to the icy continent after being freed from the seafloor, which had trapped the ice chunk in place for over a decade.

The long-lived berg, known as B-22A, is the largest remaining piece of B-22, a colossal icy mass the size of Rhode Island that snapped off Thwaites Glacier — also known as the Doomsday Glacier — in March 2002. During this time, B-22A has retained a lot of its original ice and covers around 1,160 square miles (3,000 square kilometers), which is around twice the size of Houston, Texas.

After breaking free from the glacier in the early aughts, B-22A floated freely just off the Antarctic coast until it got caught on a raised section of the seafloor in 2012. The berg became stuck around 32 miles (53 kilometers) from where it was birthed, meaning it averaged a pitiful 1.6 miles (2.6 km) of movement per year, which is one of the slowest average crawls of any iceberg on record, according to NASA
(opens in new tab)

But now, the aging iceberg has been set free and is making up for lost time. Satellite photos from NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites revealed that the berg began to move again on Oct. 24, 2022, according to NASA's Earth Observatory
(opens in new tab)
. As of March 26, B-22A has drifted around 110 miles (175 km) to the northwest, meaning it has traveled more than three times as far in six months than it managed in the previous 247 months.

Once a large iceberg calves from an ice sheet or glacier, it normally takes only a few years to journey away from polar regions and into warmer waters, where it will eventually break apart. It's rare for the floating ice chunks to stay intact for more than a decade, but it is not unheard of. In March 2013, a massive iceberg named B-15T was spotted 13 years after breaking off from Antarctica, by which time it had circled half the continent.

Scientists are particularly concerned about B-22A venturing away from Antarctica because it may impact the stability of the Thwaites Glacier. 

Stationary icebergs can cool the surrounding waters, which can have a stabilizing effect on glaciers and other ice masses but also harm marine ecosystems if they get stuck further afield, according to the Earth Observatory. In spring 2020, alarms were raised when the world's formerly largest iceberg, A68, became set on a collision course with South Georgia, an island in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Experts feared that the mighty berg would become trapped on the surrounding seafloor, like B-22A, and that its cooling effect would drastically impact the ecosystem there. (A68 eventually broke apart after narrowly missing South Georgia.)

Despite melting slower than originally thought, the Doomsday Glacier remains in a precarious situation, and recent research has shown that its melt rate could rapidly accelerate in the future. Therefore, it is important that researchers monitor any changes that may be triggered by an iceberg's departure.

—Arctic 'ghost island' that vanished may have actually been a dirty iceberg

—Massive Antarctic iceberg was ripped in two by powerful ocean currents 

Scientists will also track B-22A as it moves away from Antarctica to see where and when it will break apart. Icebergs can dump a lot of fresh water as they melt, which can impact ecosystems and ocean currents as they slowly die: A68 dumped more than 1 trillion tons [907 billion metric tons] of water into the ocean over a period of three years. 

B-22A is not the only major Antarctic iceberg to embark on a journey recently. In early March, researchers from the British Antarctic Survey took the first aerial photographs of A81, an iceberg the size of Los Angeles that broke off from the Brunt Ice Shelf on Jan. 22 after an enormous chasm finally snapped the ice sheet in half. And in October 2022, satellites spotted the world's largest iceberg, A-76A, as it entered the Drake Passage and began drifting toward the equator.

"23 days ago","The Mac Mini 2 is ideal for students, and it's on sale right now","Save $100 on the student-friendly Mac Mini M2, with deals on both the 256 and 512 GB models.","(Image credit: Apple)

Apple's latest desktop machine, the M2 Mac Mini, is small but mighty - and it's cheaper than ever at Amazon.

The Apple Silicon transition is essentially complete, with Apple's machines getting a huge power boost and battery efficiency. Things kicked off with the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, and after a few revisions, it's easy to say the best MacBook for students is par of the current lineup.

Desktops, however, have been a little slower to adapt to the M-series processors. The iMac is still running the M1, while the Mac Pro isn't quite ready to be shown just yet. In between, there are the two ""headless"" Macs - the Mac Mini and Mac Studio.

While the latter is a little on the pricey side at around $2000, the Mac Mini has arguably never been better - making it worth a look if you're not interested in the best laptops for students.

Amazon's latest round of deals makes the M2 Mac Mini just $499
(opens in new tab)
, too. It's a $100 discount that, while not huge, makes it the cheapest way to get into the macOS operating system - albeit with some caveats.

Mac Mini M2 (256GB): was $599, now $499 at Amazon

Save $100: The Mac Mini is packing Apple's latest M2 chip, and is the cheapest way to get started with Mac.

VIEW DEAL

Mac Mini M2 (512GB): was $799, now $689 at Amazon

Save $110: The 512GB storage version of the Mac Mini M2 is also on sale, with 14% off the MSRP.

VIEW DEAL

The Mac Mini is able to keep the price down because it doesn't include a monitor, mouse, or keyboard in the box. You'll need to consider that as an additional cost, but the good thing is that it means you can plug in anything you'd like - gaming peripherals, ergonomic options, ultrawide monitors and plenty more.

There are plenty of ports to accommodate those dreams, too, with HDMI, two USB-A ports, a pair of Thunderbolt 4 USB-C connections, ethernet and a headphone port.

On the inside, the M2 chip offers excellent performance across all kinds of tasks, including video editing, coding, and pretty much anything else you can think of.

Our one issue would be the 256GB of storage, which is low. Still, hooking up another drive will help, but if storage is a big concern for you, you'll find the a decent discount on the 512GB version

A rare ""hybrid"" solar eclipse is set to give viewers the show of a lifetime next week, as the moon blocks out the sun over Australia, East Timor and the eastern Indonesian islands.

On April 20, skywatchers in the region will see the moon's shadow pass in front of the sun, pocketing it like a gold coin in a magic show, before sliding away to unveil it in all its fiery glory. 

The eclipse will start at 9:34 p.m. EDT on April 19 (01:34 UTC April 20) and end at 2:59 a.m. EDT (06:59 UTC April 20), according to timeanddate.com

The sky show is called a hybrid solar eclipse because it is a combination of both a total solar eclipse and an annular solar eclipse, presenting viewers with one eclipse, then the other as the moon's shadow glides over Earth's surface. 

In a total solar eclipse the moon completely blocks out the sun, permitting the wispy strands of the solar corona to be briefly observed with the naked eye. In an annular solar eclipse, however, the moon is a little too far from Earth to totally block out the sun, creating a halo of burning plasma around the moon's outer edges that damages the eyes if viewed without eclipse glasses. 

Whether viewers will see the eclipse as a total or an annular eclipse depends on where they are positioned along Earth's curved surface relative to the moon. Most eclipse-watchers will see an annular solar eclipse, but those who find themselves beneath a slender track running from Antarctica to Western Australia will witness a total eclipse. 

Additionally, two spots will present viewers with the eclipse transitioning from annular to total and back again, but they are in the middle of the Indian Ocean. 

In Australia, a total solar eclipse will only be visible in one inhabited place — the small and remote town of Exmouth that is expected to see crowds of many thousands flocking to witness the perfect alignment of the sun, moon and Earth.

Fat sucked out of the body and tweaked with the gene-editing tool CRISPR could be used to treat cancer, a study of mice and transplanted human tissues hints. 

However, it remains to be seen whether the experimental therapy would be safe and effective in people.

The new study found that ""white fat"" extracted from the body can be genetically reprogrammed to mimic ""brown fat"" and then introduced into rodents to shrink tumors. White fat stores excess energy
(opens in new tab)
 in the body, while brown fat heats the body
(opens in new tab)
 by breaking down blood sugar, or glucose, a function that could be used to deprive tumors of the nutrients they need for growth. The study tested this idea using white fat extracted from both humans and mice, as well as tumors transplanted from humans and mice.

The buildup of white fat in the body increases the number of cells
(opens in new tab)
 that have the potential to transform into cancers, which partly explains why weight gain is linked to cancer risk. However, a 2022 study
(opens in new tab)
 involving mice and one human cancer patient suggested that, although white fat is known to increase cancer risk, brown fat could actually shrink tumors. Cold temperatures pushed glucose absorption by brown fat into overdrive and starved the tumors of fuel, the research showed.

Related: A teen's cancer is in remission after she received new cells edited with CRISPR 

The new study, which was uploaded to the preprint server bioRxiv
(opens in new tab)
 on March 29 and has yet to undergo peer review, essentially harnessed this phenomenon in a novel cancer therapy.

A team of geneticists at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) developed the therapy in mice and called it adipose modulation transplantation (AMT). The approach involves converting white fat into a brown-like ""beige"" fat outside the body by switching on genes required for ""browning.""

The team tested AMT in mouse models of breast, colon, pancreatic and prostate cancer, and found that beige fat implantation caused all of these tumors to shrink to half their size. 

Nadav Ahituv
(opens in new tab)
, a professor in UCSF's School of Pharmacy and the senior study author told Live Science that AMT ""could work very well with other therapies,"" but ""more work needs to be done"" to monitor whether the beige fat implants raise body temperature to feverish levels or cause other worrisome side effects. (Ahituv has filed a patent for AMT.)

—Prostate cancer treatments can be avoided or delayed in many cases, huge study finds

Yihai Cao
(opens in new tab)
, a cancer biologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who was not involved with the study, said AMT is a ""very interesting approach"" because, unlike most cancer therapies, it doesn't directly target the tumor, which is often difficult to reach. However, the ""long-term impact on suppressing tumor growth remains to be seen,"" said Cao, who was the senior author of the 2022 cold exposure study.

Brown fat is normally located in the neck
(opens in new tab)
 of mice and humans, but in Cao's 2022 study, tumors in the breast, skin and pancreas were suppressed despite being far from the fat. Ahituv and his team found that beige fat implanted into the back could have a similar long-distance effect, at least on breast cancer. In their other experiments, the team transplanted beige fat into mice near to transplanted tumors from the human colon, pancreas and prostate, so they still need to confirm that the fat can also exert long-distance effects on such tumors.

AMT was designed to be easily adopted in humans. White fat is commonly extracted via liposuction and reimplanted during plastic surgery. However, because cold exposure doesn't involve invasive surgery, it may be easier to adopt than AMT, Cao said. 

But fat can be implanted during prearranged cancer surgeries, such as mastectomies, Ahituv noted. And gene editing is commonly used in gene therapy and a cancer treatment known as CAR T-cell therapy, so Ahituv doesn't expect the use of CRISPR in AMT to hold back the therapy's adoption in human patients. 

AMT has only been tested in mice and in lab-cultured breast tumor samples from human cancer patients, so its efficacy and safety in humans can only be speculated until clinical trials are performed. Some studies
(opens in new tab)
 suggest that, in cancer patients, brown fat may sequester nutrients away from healthy cells and contribute to cachexia, a wasting syndrome associated with the disease. The researchers didn't observe weight loss in mice over a six-week period — but Ahituv said cachexia could appear later, so longer studies are warranted. 

Researchers will need to ""figure out the amount of fat that we implant in each patient and how much is too much,"" Ahituv said. And it could be pertinent to remove implants after some time or to install a ""kill switch"" to stop them from sapping healthy cells' nutrients, he added.

A dingo recently attacked a 6-year-old girl while she was paddling in a shallow lagoon in Australia, holding her underwater and repeatedly biting her head.

The wild dog attacked the girl on K'gari, also known as Fraser Island, on April 3. The child is in stable condition, having suffered three puncture wounds around her ear. Rangers with the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) believe the dingo responsible was an untagged male. 

""It's believed the young tourist was swimming in shallow water on the eastern side of the island when the dingo tried to grab onto her,"" LifeFlight rescuers said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""The animal repeatedly held her underwater for a few seconds before nearby family members were able to get the dingo off her.""

Authorities reported a second dingo attack on a toddler on Friday (April 14) in Karijini National Park, in Western Australia, 932 miles (1,500 kilometers) north of Perth. The boy suffered serious but non life-threatening injuries before his mother managed to fight the animal off.

Dingoes (Canis dingo) are part dog, part wolf. They are Australia's largest carnivorous mammals and typically hunt rabbits, kangaroos, wallabies and wombats
(opens in new tab)
 — but not humans. 

""Generally dingoes go about their lives and stay clear of people,"" representatives of QPWS, which is investigating the mauling, said on its website
(opens in new tab)
. ""From time to time, dingoes may come close and some encounters can turn to tragedy.""

Related: Humans are practically defenseless. Why don't wild animals attack us more?

K'gari is home to roughly 200 wild dingoes, according to the QPWS
(opens in new tab)
. They live in packs of up to 12 animals that patrol defined territories, but their curiosity occasionally draws them into tourist locations, where close encounters can turn nasty.

The QPWS urges visitors to clear away scraps of food and to never feed dingoes, as they may become increasingly habituated and emboldened in the presence of humans. Research
(opens in new tab)
 suggests the availability of human food can reduce dingoes' aggression towards each other and lead to larger numbers of animals foraging together.

If they can regularly access human leftovers, dingoes may come to associate humans with food and try to steal items that they perceive as a meal. A survey
(opens in new tab)
 of dingo attacks on K'gari between 2001 and 2015 found that more than half of the incidents involved a ""chase,"" where a person was walking or running after a wild dog to retrieve a stolen possession. This may trigger a defensive response from dingoes and has led to aggressive group attacks, according to experts writing in The Conversation
(opens in new tab)
.

—Three people gored by bison in a month at Yellowstone National Park. Why do these attacks happen?

—In 'extremely rare' attack, polar bear killed mother and child in Alaska. Now we know why. 

Although uncommon, dingo attacks on children are often linked to food — if a baby is left sitting on a picnic rug and dogs try to pinch some food, for example — or due to defensive interactions sparked by toddlers playing or running around, according to the QPWS. Altogether, there have been 33 incidents of dingoes nipping, mouthing or biting people since 2018, according to the Queensland Department of Environment and Science
(opens in new tab)
.

In December 2022, a dingo repeatedly bit a 5-year-old boy on the head, arm and buttocks in a remote camping area on K'gari. The last fatal attack on the island was in 2001, when two dingoes mauled a 9-year-old boy to death after he and his brother happened upon the dogs and tried to run away.

A nearly 100 million-year-old, exceptionally well-preserved sauropod skull discovered in Australia may show that dinosaurs trudged across Antarctica from South America to Australia, researchers have revealed.

The near-complete sauropod skull belongs to a species called Diamantinasaurus matildae. Sauropods are known for their extremely long necks, with one dinosaur's neck stretching farther than a school bus. D. matildae was also a titanosaur, the only group of sauropod dinosaurs to live right until the end of the Cretaceous (145 million to 66 million years ago) before the nonavian dinosaurs went extinct. 

Paleontologists excavated the specimen in 2018 from a sheep ranch northwest of Winton, in Queensland, Australia, and nicknamed it ""Ann."" D. matildae was as long as a tennis court (78 feet or 23.77 meters) and weighed around 27.5 tons (25 metric tons), three times more than Tyrannosaurus rex. The fossils look strikingly similar to bones unearthed in Argentina, which prompted researchers to think that sauropods journeyed between South America and Australia, via Antarctica.

""In analyzing the remains, we found similarities between the Ann skull and the skull of a titanosaur called Sarmientosaurus musacchioi, which lived in South America at about the same time as Diamantinasaurus lived in Queensland,"" Stephen Poropat
(opens in new tab)
, a paleontologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, and lead author of a new study into the fossils, said in a statement

. ""We suggest that sauropods were traveling between Australia and South America, via Antarctica, during the mid Cretaceous.""

In the hothouse world of the Cretaceous, Antarctica was blanketed with lush forests and vegetation. Scientists already knew that sauropods roamed the now-frigid landmass, after the first long-necked-dinosaur fossil in Antarctica was discovered in 2011. Some scientists had already theorized that these behemoths used Antarctica to bridge continents. At the time, Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica and South America were joined and formed the last remnant of the supercontinent Gondwana, according to the Australian Museum

Now, in a study published Wednesday (April 12) in the journal Royal Society Open Science
(opens in new tab)
, researchers compared the best-preserved sauropod skull found to date in Australia with others from across the world.

Using detailed scans of Ann's remains, the team detected remarkable similarities with a Sarmientosaurus skull that was discovered in the Chubut province in southern Argentina and described in a 2016 study in the journal PLOS One
(opens in new tab)
. ""These similarities include details of the braincase, the bones forming the back end of the skull near the jaw joint and the shape of the teeth,"" Poropat said.

Researchers already suspected that these two dinosaurs were closely related, but until now, they lacked the evidence to back it up. ""The new skull shores up the idea in a big way,"" Poropat wrote in The Conversation
(opens in new tab)
. ""Bone for bone, the skulls of Diamantinasaurus and Sarmientosaurus are extremely similar.""

(Image credit: Marie Millet, INRAP)

Archaeologists in northwest France have unearthed what may have been a temple to the Roman war god Mars, dating to the first century B.C. 

The temple, or sanctuary, is part of a Roman complex spread over more than 17 acres (7 hectares) that was discovered last year at La Chapelle-des-Fougeretz, Brittany, and was probably visited by Roman soldiers posted to the region.

""The size of the sanctuary indicates it was an important place for religion,"" Françoise Labaune-Jean

La Chapelle-des-Fougeretz has been recognized for its wealth of archaeological remains since the 1970s, and it was first excavated in the 1990s, Labaune-Jean said. The latest excavations started in 2022.

The site is slightly elevated, with a commanding view of the Rennes basin. This viewpoint makes it ""likely that religious ceremonies gathered here from Condate [the Roman city in the basin] and the surrounding area,” Labaune-Jean said in an email.

Roman war god

Archaeologists believe the site was dedicated to Mars after discovering a bronze statuette of the Roman war god in 2022, while iron weapons deposited in a ditch around the sanctuary also suggest that it was frequented by soldiers.

The discovery in 2022 of a bronze figurine of the Roman war god Mars indicates he was one of the deities worshipped at the sanctuary. (Image credit: Emmanuelle Collado, INRAP)

But a large number of terracotta figurines, perhaps representing Venus and mother goddesses, were also found in a nearby pit.

""As is often the case with religious buildings of antiquity, it is difficult to know which deity they may have been dedicated to,"" Labaune-Jean said, noting that no inscriptions or large statues have been found at the site. ""When the study of the objects discovered there is more advanced, it will perhaps be possible to propose other complementary deities.""

Julius Caesar conquered Brittany — called “Armorica” by the Romans — in 56 B.C.

The sanctuary at La Chapelle-des-Fougeretz seems to date from close to that time and was used until the fifth century A.D., according to a statement
(opens in new tab)
 from INRAP. 

The archaeologists aren't sure why the complex was abandoned, but it may be linked with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire at about that time.

Temple complex

The temple complex expanded over time to include a small town with public baths and a cemetery containing about 40 tombs.

Some of the tombs held items made of silver, such as bracelets, pins and belt buckles, while another had a dagger and parts of a harness for horses. Hundreds of everyday artifacts have also been unearthed there, including furniture and pieces of pottery, glass and metal.

Labaune-Jean role is to quickly preserve and study artifacts unearthed during the excavations, which might otherwise deteriorate quickly when exposed to air or light. X-rays and computerized 3D imaging are also being used to document the discoveries, she said.

 a sanctuary used by Roman soldiers near Zevenaar, Netherlands, said he's.cautious about assigning the sanctuary at La Chapelle-des-Fougeretz to Mars alone. 

That's because the Zevenaar sanctuary shows that Roman temples were often associated with several deities. ""When you look only at the sculptures and the weapons and military equipment, one would conclude only Hercules was venerated,"" he told Live Science. 

But careful research shows instead that several different gods were worshiped there. ""It is quite dangerous to assign a deity to a sanctuary based only on the finds,"" and not inscriptions or texts, he said.

"24 days ago","Gravity can transform into light, mind-bending physics paper suggests","In the early universe, gravity may have been capable of creating light, a new theoretical paper finds.","Can gravity create light? (Image credit: dani3315 via Getty Images)

Gravity can turn itself into light, but only if space-time behaves in just the right way, a research team has found.

Under normal circumstances, you cannot get something from nothing. Specifically, the Standard Model of particle physics, the reigning theory that explains the subatomic zoo of particles, usually forbids the transformation of massless particles into massive ones. While particles in the Standard Model constantly change into each other through various reactions and processes, the photon — the massless carrier of light — cannot normally change into other particles. But if the conditions are just right, it is possible — for example, when a photon interacts with a heavy atom, it can spontaneously split off to become an electron and a positron, both of which are massive particles.

With this well-known example in hand, a team of theoretical physicists, writing in a paper posted March 28 to the preprint database arXiv
(opens in new tab)
, asked if gravity itself could transform into other particles. We normally think of gravity through the lens of general relativity, where bends and warps in space-time influence the motion of particles. In that picture, it would be very difficult to imagine how gravity could create particles. But we can also view gravity through a quantum lens, picturing the gravitational force as carried by countless invisible particles called gravitons. While our picture of quantum gravity is far from complete, we do know that these gravitons would behave like any other fundamental particle, including potentially transforming.

To test this idea, the researchers studied the conditions of the extremely early universe. When our cosmos was very young, it was also small, hot and dense. In that youthful cosmos, all forms of matter and energy were ramped up to unimaginable scales, far greater than even our most powerful particle colliders are capable of achieving. 

RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...

The researchers found that in this setup, gravitational waves — ripples in the fabric of space-time generated by collisions between the most massive cosmic objects — play an important role. Normally, gravitational waves are exceedingly weak, capable of nudging an atom through a distance less than the width of its own nucleus. But in the early universe, the waves could have been much stronger, and that  could have seriously influenced everything else.

Artist impression of gravitational waves. (Image credit: R. Hurt/Caltech-JPL)

Those early waves would have sloshed back and forth, amplifying themselves. Anything else in the universe would have gotten caught up in the push and pull of the waves, leading to a resonance effect. Like a kid pumping their legs at just the right time to send a swing higher and higher, the gravitational waves would have acted as a pump, driving matter into tight clumps over and over again.

The gravitational waves could also affect the electromagnetic field. Because the waves are ripples in space-time itself, they don't limit themselves to interactions with massive objects. As the waves continue to pump, they can drive radiation in the universe to extremely high energies, causing the spontaneous appearance of photons: gravity generating light itself.

The researchers found that in general, this process is rather inefficient. The early universe was also expanding, so the standard patterns of gravitational waves would not have lasted long. However, the team found that if the early universe contained enough matter that the speed of light was reduced (the same way light travels more slowly through a medium such as air or water), the waves could have stuck around long enough to really get things going, generating floods of extra photons.

Physicists do not yet fully understand the complicated, tangled physics of the early universe, which was capable of achieving feats never observed since. This new research adds one more strand to the rich tapestry: the capability for gravity to create light. That radiation would presumably then go on to influence the formation of matter and the evolution of the universe, so working out the full implications of this surprising process could lead to new revolutions in our understanding of the earliest moments of the cosmos.

This idea meshes well with one of the (half dozen) theories about multiverse generation. Imagine, using the proverbial metaphor of an elastic sheet to visualize gravity, a black hole weighting down the middle, eventually becoming so massive it drops off like a blob of honey, metaphorically speaking, creating a new universe. I forget the physicist or mathematician who proposed...

Beyond the smallest particles, Electrons, Quarks, tau-Neutrinos, etc there are sub-sub atomic particles in the Sea of Dirac.
These sub-sub atomic particles make up all the above particles including mass and charged Protons, Neutrons, neutrinos, etc, and extremely massless and chargeless Photons.
Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons have a permanent either positive, neutral, or negative spin.

The idea that gravity (spacetime) can create light is not new. It was explicitly hypothesized in a 2021 article as part of a much larger cosmological theory called Probabilistic Spacetime (Doren, D.M. and Harasymiw, J. (2021) Everything is Probabilistic Spacetime: An Integrative Theory. Int J Cosmol Astron Astrophys, 3, 1: 130-144. https://doi:10.18689/ijcaa-1000127).

Ancient Egypt was ruled for millennia by a series of pharaohs. Historians have broken up this period into dynasties, in which the rulers were either related to one another or derived power from a predecessor.

But which dynasty lasted the longest?

The 18th dynasty of Egypt, which lasted around 250 years, is the longest ancient Egyptian dynasty. Scientists estimate the length of the 18th dynasty by analyzing written records and radiocarbon dates.

The 18th dynasty started around 1550 B.C., when the pharaoh Ahmose kicked out the Hyksos, a group originating from Asia that had ruled part of ancient Egypt for more than a century. The rulers who followed Ahmose would grow the territory that Egypt controlled, eventually expanding it to an empire stretching from modern-day Sudan to what is now Syria. Among the 18th dynasty rulers is Tutankhamun, or King Tut, a pharaoh whose intact tomb was rediscovered by a British-led archaeological team in 1922.

Historians often divide Egypt's history into 30 dynasties.

But in fact, ""the 'dynasties' of Egypt are really just retrospective constructs,"" Michael Dee
(opens in new tab)
, an associate professor of isotope chronology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, told Live Science in an email. It wasn't until around 300 B.C. that writers started to divide Egypt into dynasties, Dee said. While many pharaohs within a dynasty have a direct family relationship, not all do. 

""Dynasties are successive members of the same family with some additions,"" Marc Van De Mieroop
(opens in new tab)
, a history professor at Columbia University, told Live Science in an email. ""They were made up by Manetho, who wrote a history of Egypt in Greek in the [third] century B.C. The 18th dynasty [pharaohs] are related to each other by descent except for the final two who had very brief reigns.""

And although the 18th dynasty was the longest of the dynasties delineated by Manetho, the periods of Greek and Roman rule were longer, Van De Mieroop said.

Greek rule in Egypt started in 332 B.C., when Alexander the Great conquered Egypt. Prior to his conquest, the region was controlled by the ancient Persians. 

After Alexander died in 323 B.C., his empire fell apart and Ptolemy, one of Alexander's generals, became ruler of Egypt. His descendants ruled Egypt for nearly 300 years, until the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 B.C.

After Cleopatra's death, the Roman emperor Augustus incorporated Egypt into the Roman Empire as a province. While Roman emperors rarely visited Egypt, surviving artwork shows that they were nevertheless regarded as pharaohs. While the Western Roman Empire fell in A.D. 476, the Eastern Roman Empire (often called the Byzantine Empire), based at Constantinople, continued on and controlled Egypt until A.D. 646, when the Rashidun Caliphate captured it. The Rashidun Caliphate was based in Arabia and formed after the death of Muhammed.

"26 days ago","Scientists discover 1st 'neutron-rich' isotope of uranium since 1979","Scientists have synthesized a previously unknown isotope of uranium, uranium-241, that may start to disappear after just 40 minutes.","An example of uranium nitrate called uranyl with some uranium ore. (Image credit: RHJ via Getty Images)

Scientists have discovered and synthesized an entirely new isotope of the highly radioactive element uranium. But it might last only 40 minutes before decaying into other elements. 

The new isotope, uranium-241, has 92 protons (as all uranium isotopes do) and 149 neutrons, making it the first new neutron-rich isotope of uranium discovered since 1979. While atoms of a given element always have the same number of protons, different isotopes, or versions, of those elements may hold different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. To be considered neutron-rich, an isotope must contain more neutrons than is common to that element.

Uranium is in the class of elements in the periodic table known as ""actinides,"" which have proton counts between 89 and 103. All actinides are radioactive, but uranium is one of the four most radioactive elements, alongside radium, polonium and thorium.

""We measured the masses of 19 different actinide isotopes with a high precision of one part per million level, including the discovery and identification of the new uranium isotope,"" Toshitaka Niwase
(opens in new tab)
, a researcher at the High-energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) Wako Nuclear Science Center (WNSC) in Japan, told Live Science in an email. ""This is the first new discovery of a uranium isotope on the neutron-rich side in over 40 years.""

Niwase is the lead author of a study on the new uranium isotope, which was published March 31 in the journal Physical Review Letters
(opens in new tab)
. 

Isotopes can be stable, meaning they keep their atomic configuration, or unstable, meaning they decay and break down into other elements by gaining or shedding protons. Decay rates are measured by an isotope's half-life, or the time it takes for half the material to decay into other elements. After two half-lives, a quarter of the material remains; after three, an eighth, and so on. 

The team hasn't yet measured the half-life of uranium-241, but theoretical estimates put it at around 40 minutes, Niwase said. This is somewhat short for a half-life. (For reference, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years, the half-life of the very unstable isotope technetium-99m is six hours and the half-life of francium-223 is 22 minutes. The fastest-decaying isotope, hydrogen-7, is half gone in just 10^-23 seconds.)

—How the periodic table of the elements is arranged

—Scientists create never-before-seen isotope of magnesium 

Niwase and colleagues created the uranium-241 by firing a sample of uranium-238 at platinum-198 nuclei at Japan's RIKEN accelerator. The two isotopes then swapped neutrons and protons — a phenomenon called ""multinucleon transfer.""

The team then measured the mass of the created isotopes by observing the time it took the resulting nuclei to travel a certain distance through a medium. The experiment also generated 18 new isotopes, all of which contained between 143 and 150 neutrons.

Niwase acknowledged that uranium-241 probably doesn't have many useful practical or scientific implementations, as the isotope is created in extremely small numbers.

Earth is roughly 4.54 billion years old. In that time, it has seen continents form and disappear, ice caps expand and retreat, and life evolve from single-celled organisms into blue whales.

But how do we know Earth's age? We start by looking inside it.

""When you're an Earth scientist who looks at a rock, it's not just a rock; it's like that rock has a story that you can try to decipher,"" said Becky Flowers

When minerals form out of magma or lava, they often contain traces of radioactive material, such as uranium. Over time, those radioactive elements decay, meaning they spew radiation,  eventually transforming them into new, more stable elements that remain trapped inside the mineral. 

RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...

Take radioactive uranium-238, a common form of uranium. Its atoms will release energy until they eventually turn into lead. That process occurs at a fixed rate known as a half-life, which corresponds to the amount of time it takes for half of the atoms to decay. The half-life of uranium-238 is more than 4 billion years, meaning it takes more than 4 billion years for half of the uranium-238 in a sample to become lead. This makes it perfect for dating objects that are very, very old.

By knowing these half-lives, we can calculate how old a rock is based on the ratio of the ""parent"" radioactive element and the ""daughter"" stable element — a method called radiometric dating.

Related: How do scientists figure out how old things are?

The mineral zircon is commonly used for radiometric dating because it contains a relatively large amount of uranium, Flowers said. Uranium-lead dating is just one type of radiometric dating. Other types use different elements; for example, radiocarbon dating, one of the most common methods, uses a radioactive isotope of carbon that has a half-life of thousands of years and is useful for dating organic matter. 

Using these methods, geologists have found minerals on Earth that date as far back as 4.4 billion years, meaning the planet has been around at least that long. But if scientists say Earth is more than 4.5 billion years old, where did those extra 100 million years or so come from?

Earth, as mentioned, has changed a lot over billions of years, especially through processes such as plate tectonics, which shift the crust, birthing new land out of magma and subducting old land back underground. As a result, rocks from the very beginning of the planet's history are hard to find; they've long since eroded or melted back into raw material.

RELATED MYSTERIES

—How do fossils form?

—Can rocks grow?

—What is the ‘man in the moon’ and how did it form?

But scientists can use radiometric dating to determine the age of rocks from other parts of the solar system, too. Some meteorites contain materials that are more than 4.56 billion years old
(opens in new tab)
,  and rocks from the moon and Mars have also been dated to around 4.5 billion years ago.

Those dates are pretty close to the time scientists think the solar system started to take shape
(opens in new tab)
 out of the cloud of gas and dust surrounding the newborn sun. And by knowing all of these relative ages, we can start to piece together a timeline of how Earth, the moon, Mars and all of the other little rocks floating around in nearby space started to form.

Yet the transition from primordial dust cloud to planet Earth didn't happen all at once but rather over millions of years, Rebecca Fischer
(opens in new tab)
, an Earth and planetary scientist at Harvard University, told Live Science. That means our understanding of Earth's age will always be less about a specific year when the planet formed and more about a general sense of the era when our home planet started to take shape.

We may have said that the iPad Pro is a pricey piece of hardware in the past, but this deal goes a long wait to fixing that.

While the iPad Pro M2 is out now, it doesn't do a lot extra, making the M1 the place to find a bargain - and Amazon has one that makes it a little easier on the wallet for anyone looking for one of the best tablets for students.

The retailer has the iPad Pro with M1 and 512GB storage for $1099.99
(opens in new tab)
, marking a $500 discount. That's almost a third of the MSRP snipped off, but it only applies to the Space Gray version - so Silver fans are out of luck this time. There is also just shy of $50 off the iPad Air
(opens in new tab)
, if you want something a even cheaper.

iPad Pro M1 (12.9-inch) - was $1,599.99, now $1099.99 at Amazon

Apple’s M1-powered Pro tablet is a fantastic tablet with an incredible display.

VIEW DEAL

iPad Air M1- was $599, now $551 at Amazon

Looking for a smaller tablet that matches the iPad Pro for performance? This iPad Air is our recommendation for the best tablet for students.

VIEW DEAL

The iPad Pro features a 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, which is one of the best tablet displays around - offering backlighting that makes for stunning contrast by using local dimming zones. You won't find the tech in the 11-inch, either.

The M1 chip inside is the same found in the iMac and some MacBooks, too, so it's powerful enough to run anything you want on the App Store - whether that's running any professional design apps like ProCreate or LumaFusion, or playing the most demanding games like Genshin Impact.

iPadOS has seen big upgrades in recent years, too, with Stage Manager allowing true windowed views - blurring the lines between tablet and laptop. You can even connect it to an external display, too.

The $500 you save can buy you the Apple Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil (2nd Generation), too - but neither are mandatory.

In our iPad Pro 12.9 (M1, 2021) review, we awarded the tablet 4 out of 5 stars and said:

“The iPad Pro 12.9-inch with M1 is the most expensive Apple tablet, but it’s a tough value proposition that’s wedged between the 2022 iPad Air and a MacBook”.

We love the iPad lineup, but Apple's tablets are getting further out of the realms of possibility for many buyers with price hikes at the low end and relatively small updates with the iPad.

A massive ocean floor lurks near Earth's core. Now, seismic imaging has revealed that it likely surrounds much — if not all — of the core. 

This thin, dense layer is lodged roughly 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) below Earth's surface, between the core and the planet's middle layer, called the mantle. And it might encompass the entire core-mantle boundary, according to a study published April 5 in the journal Science Advances
(opens in new tab)
. 

To study Earth's interior, seismologists measure earthquake waves that zoom through the planet and then back out to Earth's surface. By seeing how these waves change after passing through the different structures inside Earth, researchers can create a map of what Earth's innards look like. Past research identified a handful of isolated pockets of dense ocean crust near the core. These pockets are called ultra-low-velocity-zone structures (ULVZs) because seismic waves travel very slowly through them.

""Only [approximately] 20% of the core-mantle boundary has been previously investigated for ULVZs, which have not been identified in all of these locations,"" lead study author Samantha Hansen
(opens in new tab)
, an associate professor of geological sciences at The University of Alabama, told Live Science in an email. ""It is possible that this anomalous material covers the entire core.""

In the new study, scientists placed seismic equipment at 15 stations located across Antarctica and collected data for three years.

This study marks the first time that high-resolution imaging of the core-mantle boundary was made using data from the Southern Hemisphere. The layer itself is razor-thin compared with the core, which is 450 miles (724 km) across, and the mantle, which is roughly 1,800 miles (2,900 km) thick.

""The thickness does vary, depending on location,"" Hansen said, with some spots measuring about 3.1 miles (5 km) thick and others 31 miles (50 km) in thickness.

This ancient ocean layer likely developed when Earth's tectonic plates shifted, causing oceanic material to be carried into the planet's interior at subduction zones, the areas where two plates collide and force one to dip beneath the other. Over time, ""accumulations of subducted oceanic material collect along the core-mantle boundary and are pushed by the slowly flowing rock in the mantle,"" according to a statement
(opens in new tab)
. 

Researchers think the newly detected ULVZs are essentially ""underground mountains"" that allow heat to escape from Earth's molten core, according to the statement.

""The presence of this layer could buffer heat flow across the core-mantle boundary, which is important because the temperature conditions in this portion of the Earth have been shown to strongly impact the planet's magnetic field,"" Hansen said.

Chunks of this hidden ocean floor may also get swept up into mantle plumes — hot, upwelling jets of molten rock that fuel volcanic hotspots at the surface, such as in Hawaii, Hansen suggested. 

""Further, since mantle plumes are largely controlled by the thermal conditions near the core-mantle boundary, the temperature influence of ULVZs may help dictate where plumes form,"" Hansen said.

The research team plans to expand their study by examining data collected from all available seismic stations in Antarctica.

Ocean surface temperatures have hit an all-time high this month, breaking every record since satellite measurements began in the 1980s. 

Temperatures reached a global average of 69.98 Fahrenheit (21.1 degrees Celsius) in the first days of April. The previous record of 69.9 F (21 degrees C) was set in March 2016. Both are more than a degree higher than the global average between 1982 and 2011, which runs at around 68.72 F (20.4 C) in early spring, according to data from the University of Maine Climate Reanalyzer
(opens in new tab)
. 

The new record is the result of the buildup of heat from climate change, now unsuppressed by La Niña — a natural ocean cycle of cold surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific that had been ongoing for three years, but which ended in March

""Now La Niña is over and the tropical Pacific, which is a huge expansive ocean, is warming up,"" said Michael McPhaden
(opens in new tab)
, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle.

The background trend across the ocean surface, land surface, and atmosphere, is one of warming, McPhaden said. As greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere, all three heat up. But the trends wobble up and down a bit based on La Niña and El Niño cycles. (During El Niño years, the Pacific surface heats up.) 

""Even though greenhouse gas concentrations in 2022 were the highest ever, it was not the warmest year on record"" in terms of global surface temperatures, McPhaden said. That’s because of  La Niña. ""Twenty-sixteen was the warmest year on record, and that’s because we had this high burden of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere plus a major El Niño. The combination shot the global surface temps into record territory.""

Some calculations put 2020 as the hottest year on record, while others call it a tie between 2016 and 2020. NOAA's calculations put 2020's average global land and ocean temperatures at 1.76 F (0.98 C) higher than average and only 0.04 F (0.02 C) cooler than 2016.

Currently, the Pacific is in a neutral state of neither El Niño nor La Niña. But forecast models put the chances of tipping into an El Niño later this year at roughly 60%, McPhaden said, which could mean another record-breaking heat year. There is typically a lag between when these oceanic cycles start and when surface temperatures heat up, he said. 

""It’s likely that if we have a big El Niño, we would see a new record set in 2024,"" he said. 

Still, it's difficult to predict El Niños from early spring trends, McPhaden said, because the oceanic system is volatile this time of year and can easily swing from one pattern to another.

—10 signs we got closer to climate disaster in 2022

—What are the effects of global warming? 

Climate scientists are still trying to unravel how ocean warming will alter the typical cycle of La Niña and El Niño, he said, but the current consensus is that extremes in both directions will become larger and more frequent. Major El Niños and their accompanying high sea surface temperatures in the Pacific may become twice as common by the end of the 21st century, McPhaden said, which would mean that instead of occurring approximately every 20 years, they might happen every 10. 

The current extremes are already affecting ocean life. Marine heat waves, where ocean temperatures in a particular region rise above the levels that native organisms can tolerate are becoming more common. Particularly vulnerable are corals, which expel the symbiotic single-celled organisms that they host when the water becomes too hot. Corals can survive this process, called bleaching, every once in a while —  but if it happens too often, the corals will die. 

""This is one of the big concerns about rising ocean temps, how it’s going to affect marine ecosystems,"" McPhaden said. ""Coral reef communities have real economic consequences, from the tourism and livelihood of island nations but also protein from the sea. They're a tremendous food source for many nations, and the threats of global warming and pollution and overfishing is a triple whammy.""

(Image credit: Image courtesy of Grigory Kessel)

A historian studying a text in the Vatican has discovered a hidden fragment of the Gospel of Matthew, written in Old Syriac, that differs from what is seen today in the Bible. 

The alternate version of the gospel was revealed using ultraviolet (UV) photography. As parchment was scarce in the Middle Ages, scribes often reused parchments, writing over older texts, researchers said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. 

The most recent text on the parchment is written in Georgian, and there is an earlier text underneath it written in Greek. But when Grigory Kessel
(opens in new tab)
, a scholar who studies Syriac with the Austrian Academy of Sciences, examined UV images provided by the Vatican library, he found yet another layer hidden beneath the Greek text.

The Old Syriac text contains part of Matthew 12:1. Kessel speculated that someone copied the verse onto the parchment during the sixth century. Based on the language, Kessel estimates that the original may have been produced in the third century.

This gospel, which has traditionally been attributed to the apostle Matthew, was likely written sometime in the second half of the first century. So the newly discovered text is probably about 200 years younger than the bulk of the gospel.

Today the passage reads: ""at that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and his disciples became hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat,"" the statement noted. However, the recently discovered Old Syriac text says the disciples ""began to pick the heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat them.""

Kessel told Live Science that he is aware of only one other Gospel copy, written in Old Latin, that claimed the disciples rubbed grain in their hands. It's not clear if rubbing the grain had any religious significance. 

""This is indeed an exciting discovery, and a brilliant piece of decipherment,"" Sebastian Brock
(opens in new tab)
, a retired professor of Syriac at the University of Oxford, told Live Science in an email. Brock noted that Old Syriac and Old Latin copies of the gospels often differ from other versions of the gospels. The gospels gradually became more standardized during the Middle Ages. 

Discoveries like these are ""significant for the study of the early history of the text of the New Testament before it reached the form familiar from modern editions and translations,"" Brock said.

Please. It's not religious, it's practical. They were separating the edible part of the grain from the husk/straw (threshing). The author has obviously never tried to eat grain straight off the stalk before.

I agree that it's a interesting discovery, but I don't there's anything religiously significant or otherwise (outside of a textual level) about the alternate reading of Matthew 12:1 having ""the disciples rubbed grain in their hands"".

The significance may be that these are acts that are forbidden on the Sabbath according to Jewish law.

The novelty is actually the location in Matthew, as the rubbing of the grain in the hands is found in Luke 6:1. My understanding is that Tatian's harmony of the Gospels known as the Diatessaron may have been the first translation into Syriac. This was thought to have used Matthew as the base of the harmony, and might account...

Scientists have pinpointed 145 potential ""height genes"" in cells that make up the cartilage at the ends of children's bones and affect how tall they grow.

These cartilage cells, known as chondrocytes, multiply and mature in areas of tissue called growth plates, which sit near the ends of long bones in children and teens and determine each bone's future length and shape. When a person's growth is complete, these cartilaginous growth plates ""close"" and are replaced by hard bone. Scientists already knew that chondrocytes play a role in bone growth and human height, but narrowing down which genes control the cells' growth — and, thus, our statures — has proved difficult.

""Pinpointing specific genes associated with human height is a challenging task, as height is a complex trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors,"" Dr. Nora Renthal
(opens in new tab)
, a pediatric endocrinologist at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and senior of the new study, told Live Science in an email. ""Our study focused on cartilage cells specifically because they are the primary cell type involved in bone growth.""

In a study published Friday (April 14) in the journal Cell Genomics
(opens in new tab)
, Renthal and her colleagues screened 600 million mouse cartilage cells to find genes that influence how the cells proliferate and mature. They used CRISPR genome-editing technology to ""knock out"" candidate genes, which allowed the researchers to observe what happened when these genes were erased and no longer regulated cartilage cells.

Related: What determines a person's height? 

The researchers found 145 genes that, when knocked out, triggered abnormal growth and development of mouse cartilage cells. These patterns of abnormal growth were similar to those seen in certain skeletal disorders, such as skeletal dysplasia — a group of genetic disorders that affect the development of bones, joints and cartilage in babies. Those with skeletal dysplasia are typically of short stature and have short limbs, among other symptoms.

Next, the researchers compared these 145 mouse genes with previous results from large-scale genetic studies of human height, called genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In those studies, researchers compared the DNA of thousands of people of different heights to look for gene variants associated with height, Renthal explained. To control for non-genetic factors that influence the trait under study, such as nutrition and disease in the case of human height, these factors are incorporated into GWAS, according to a 2021 review published in the journal Nature Reviews Methods Primers
(opens in new tab)
.

""These studies have contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits like height by identifying specific genetic regions and genes that are associated with the trait,"" Renthal said.

The comparison revealed a remarkable overlap between genetic ""hotpots"" linked to human height in the GWAS and the 145 genes that control cartilage cell growth in mice. This means that these genes, which the researchers have now precisely located in the human genome, could influence height more than other genetic factors do.

""Our current study has helped to identify new genes potentially involved in bone growth and development,"" Renthal said. ""Specific genes and pathways involved in the maturation and proliferation of chondrocytes, the cells that make up cartilage in our bones, play a critical role in human height.""

Results from mouse cells may not mirror cellular processes in humans, Renthal noted in a statement
(opens in new tab)
, but the researchers think height genes could come in handy in clinical settings. 

""It is our hope that the identification of these 145 genes will help patients with skeletal dysplasia and other skeletal disorders,"" Renthal told Live Science.

The volatile comet, known as 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann (29P), is around 37 miles (60 kilometers) wide and takes around 14.9 years to orbit the sun. As well as being volcanic, 29P has an unusually circular orbit for a comet and rotates much more slowly than expected. It is one of around 100 comets, known as ""centaurs,"" that have been pushed from the Kuiper Belt — a ring of icy comets that lurk beyond Neptune — into a closer orbit around the sun nearer Jupiter.

Unlike volcanoes on Earth, which eject scalding-hot magma and ash from the planet's mantle, 29P spits out extremely cold gases and ice from its supercold interior. This unusual type of volcanic activity is known as cryovolcanism, or ""cold volcanism.""

On April 2, scientists from the British Astronomical Association (BAA) observed a sharp spike in 29P's brightness, which was caused by light reflecting off recently ejected gas and ice, or cryomagma, in the comet's coma — the cloud of gas that surrounds a comet's body, or nucleus. The eruption was likely quite sizable given that the coma outshone the nucleus by a factor of more than 10, Spaceweather.com
(opens in new tab)
 reported, but its exact strength has not yet been quantified.  

The eruption was ""like a cork popping from a champagne bottle,"" according to Spaceweather.com.

29P is one of the most volcanically active comets in the solar system, and researchers have seen it blow its top hundreds of times before. In November 2022, the icy comet experienced a massive eruption that spewed out more than 1 million tons of cryomagma, making it the second-largest explosion of its kind recorded in the last 12 years. But, like with all other past eruptions from 29P, astronomers had no idea that the huge eruption was imminent before it happened. 

However, this time, researchers strongly suspected that 29P was going to erupt.

Cryovolcanic bodies, which include a handful of other comets and several solar system moons such as Saturn's Enceladus, Jupiter's Europa and Neptune's Triton, have a surface crust surrounding a mainly solid icy core, Richard Miles
(opens in new tab)
, a BAA astronomer who has studied 29P, told Live Science last year. Over time, radiation from the sun can cause a comet's icy interior to sublime from solid to gas, which causes a buildup of pressure beneath the crust, although some gas continually leaks out at the same time. When radiation from the sun weakens the crust, that pressure causes the outer shell to crack, and cryomagma shoots out into space.

On April 1, BAA astronomers noticed that the light surrounding the comet's nucleus was ""the faintest we have ever seen it,"" Miles wrote in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. This was a sign that less gas was leaking out from the comet's outer crust than usual, suggesting pressure was building up at an increased rate within the comet, he added. This made an eruption ""highly likely to happen.""

The latest eruption is proof that 29P's eruptions can be predicted in advance, which will hopefully help researchers to study future eruptions in greater detail.

(Image credit: agsandrew via Shutterstock)

Human beings can generate false memories of events mere seconds after they have occurred, a new study has found. 

The phenomenon, which researchers have dubbed ""short-term memory illusions,"" shows how easily and rapidly humans reimagine experiences to fit our preconceptions, rather than accurately recording what takes place. The researchers published their findings April 5 in the journal PLOS One
(opens in new tab)
.

""It seems that short-term memory is not always an accurate representation of what was just perceived,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""Instead, memory is shaped by what we expected to see, right from the formation of the first memory trace.""

To test the accuracy of short-term memories, the researchers enlisted 534 volunteers to take part in a series of four experiments, each designed around memorizing a sequence of letters of the Latin alphabet. 

In each round, participants were shown a collection of letters, arranged in a circle. Those letters would then disappear and a box would pop up at a specific position in the circle, to indicate which letter they should remember. Participants had to remember both the letter's identity and the direction it was facing, as some had been mirrored to face backwards. 

Sometimes, participants were shown a second, irrelevant batch of letters before their memory was tested. After giving the answer, they were then asked to score their confidence, from very low to very high, that they had guessed correctly.

—How does the brain store memories?

—Sherlock Holmes' famous memory trick really works

When the participants were asked to recall what they saw just a half second later, they were wrong just under 20% of the time, and this error rate shot up to 30% when asked three seconds later. When asked to recall whether a letter was facing forwards or backwards, participants who responded with high confidence had flipped the letter to its regular position 37% of the time, even though they had been explicitly warned that mirrored letters would appear in the tests and should not be mistakenly reported for real ones.

To confirm their findings, the researchers repeated the tests across three similar experiments with a cohort of 348 people not included in the original analysis, who showed the same tendency to mentally flip the mirrored letters. Across all experiments, this mental letter-flipping was the most common high-confidence error — a sign that human brains record experience based on preset notions (in this case, how a letter should appear) that enable us to generate better predictions about the world, while pruning out peculiarities that don't fit with those preconceptions.

""These memory illusions seem to be the result of world knowledge and not of visual similarities,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""Taken together, the results thus show that world knowledge can shape memory even when memories have only just been formed.""

The researchers' next steps are to design experiments that could demonstrate similar short-term memory adjustments in real-world settings, as well as for other types of memory besides those related to visual and language-related stimuli.

"27 days ago","Never-before-seen 'crystal-like matter' hidden in a chunk of fossilized lightning is probably a brand new mineral","The potential new mineral was discovered in a chunk of ""fossilized lightning,"" or fulgurite, that was left behind when a tree in Florida was struck by lightning.","A close-up of the fossilized lightning, or fulgurite, that contained the potential new mineral. (Image credit: Bindi et al. 2023, (CC BY 4.0))

A potentially brand new mineral may have been hiding inside a chunk of ""fossilized lightning"" from Florida, scientists have revealed. 

""We have never seen this material occur naturally on Earth,"" Mathew Pasek
(opens in new tab)
, a geoscientist at the University of South Florida, said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""Minerals similar to it can be found in meteorites and space, but we've never seen this exact material anywhere.""

The fossilized lightning chunk, or fulgurite, was created when lightning struck a tree near New Port Richey. Fulgurites form when powerful lightning bolts discharge through the ground, which melts and fuses any nearby soil, sand, rock and organic debris into a singular metallic-looking lump.

The owner of the New Port Richey tree sold the fulgurite to Pasek, who studies high-energy chemical reactions like those triggered by lightning. After cracking open the rocky lump, which was around 2.8 inches (7 cenitmeters) long and 0.8 inches (2 cm) wide, Pasek and fellow researchers discovered a ""colorful, crystal-like matter"" within the fulgurite. Subsequent analysis revealed that the mysterious matter was a previously unknown material consisting mainly of calcium phosphate (CaHPO3). The team strongly suspects that the new material is a brand-new mineral type, but it will take time for this to be confirmed by other scientists.

The researchers published their findings March 14 in the journal Communications Earth & Environment
(opens in new tab)
.

During their analysis, the researchers also tried, and failed, to recreate the mineral in a lab. The scientists believe they failed to recreate the new material because it rapidly forms under precise conditions that are hard to predict and replicate: Every time they got close, the compound would start to break down into something else because it had been heated for too long. 

RELATED STORIES

—'Gigantic jet' that shot into space may be the most powerful lightning bolt ever detected

—Why does lightning zigzag?

The researchers hope that this form of calcium phosphate can soon be confirmed as a new mineral, at which point it will be officially named. They also believe that other brand-new mineral types could be created through a similar pathway and want to examine more fulgurites to test this theory.

This is not the first time that an unexpected compound has been discovered in fossilized lightning. In December 2022, researchers found a rare type of quasicrystal in a fulgurite unearthed in Nebraska's Sandhills. (Quasicrystals are unusual, ""rule-breaking"" crystals with patterns that do not repeat.)

You're calling this rare, pretty rock a fossil. Sometimes in quotes, sometimes not. Was this to imply a certain irony, or were you attributing the term to Dr. Pasek?

No age estimate is given for said fossil or ""fossil"", nor do you identify the geological substrate where it was found. Or was it simply buried in loose dirt...

Early risers will get a chance to see beautiful Saturn shining just above a slim waning crescent moon this week. 

To spot the spectacular ringed planet dangling over the moon, look just above the east-southeast horizon about an hour before sunrise on Sunday, April 16.

The crescent moon will be just 17% illuminated as it wanes toward becoming a new moon on April 20. That's a great time to see ""Earthshine"" on the dark limb of the moon. This sunlight reflected from our planet makes the dark lunar surface visible to the naked eye, though it looks best through a pair of good stargazing binoculars. With a telescope, Saturn's rings should be visible.

To spot Saturn, look just 5 degrees above the moon. The ringed planet is rising two minutes earlier each morning compared to sunrise, according to When the Curves Line Up
(opens in new tab)
, a skywatching website run by astronomy educator Jeffrey Hunt. Saturn has been traveling farther from the sun from our point of view after its solar conjunction on Feb. 16, but Saturn is still difficult to see in twilight.

 and then use the moon as a guide to finding Saturn. 

You should also be able to glimpse Saturn and the crescent moon the morning before and after their close conjunction. Before sunrise on Saturday, April 15, the crescent moon will be 27% illuminated and shine about 10 degrees to the right of Saturn. On Monday, April 17, the moon will be just 10% lit and barely visible about 10 degrees to the lower left of Saturn.

For more than a decade, archaeologists have struggled to decipher an inscription carved into the neck of a broken jar that dates back to King Solomon's reign in ancient Israel. Now, researchers have finally revealed the mysterious message's meaning.

Based on the new interpretation, published in January in the Jerusalem Journal of Archaeology

, the inscription was engraved using Ancient South Arabian script in Sabaean, a common language that was spoken during biblical times on the Arabian Peninsula in the kingdom of Sheba, in what is today Yemen. 

The text on the jar reads ""ladanum 5,"" a reference to labdanum (Cistus ladanifer), an aromatic, plant-derived resin that was used to make incense, according to a Hebrew University of Jerusalem statement

The inscription is thought to be the oldest known Ancient South Arabian script found in Israel, according to the study.

Related: King Solomon's mines were abandoned and became a desert wasteland. Here's why.

The shard of pottery — which archaeologists found buried alongside portions of six other large jars during a 2012 excavation in Ophel, a section of Jerusalem — dates to the 10th century B.C. Researchers consider it a ""clear connection"" to the biblical kingdom of Solomon and the nearby kingdom of Sheba, according to the statement.

""The vessel is locally made, and the inscription was engraved by a Sabaean speaker holding a position related to incense,"" study author Daniel Vainstub
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, told Live Science in an email. ""That proves a strong relation between the two kingdoms.""

Centuries ago, the kingdom of Sheba was instrumental in cultivating the plants needed to produce perfume and incense, while the kingdom of Solomon controlled the trade routes that crisscrossed the Negev desert and led to the Mediterranean ports where goods were then exported, according to the study.

""Deciphering the inscription on this jar teaches us not only about the presence of a speaker of Sabaean in Israel during the time of King Solomon, but also about the geopolitical relations system in our region at that time — especially in light of the place where the jar was discovered, an area known for also being the administrative center during the days of King Solomon,"" Vainstub said in the statement. 

""This is another testament to the extensive trade and cultural ties that existed between Israel under King Solomon and the Kingdom of Sheba,"" he said.

"28 days ago","The most elusive black holes in the universe could lurk at the Milky Way's center","Astronomers have a plan for using ripples in space-time to hunt for elusive intermediate-mass black holes around the Milky Way's center.","Clouds of X-ray radiation at the Milky Way's center reveal a supermassive black hole -- and possibly other, even more exotic objects. (Image credit: ESA/XMM-Newton/G. Ponti et al. 2019, Nature)

The most elusive black holes in the universe aren't the big ones, or the small ones. They're the medium ones —  and a team of astronomers has proposed a new method, using ripples in space-time, to hunt for them.

Known black holes come in two general varieties. There are the stellar-mass black holes, which range from a few to a few dozen times the mass of the sun. And then there are the supermassive black holes, which range in mass from  a million suns all the way up to 50 billion solar masses.

Astronomers theorize that there might be some black holes caught in between these two extremes, known as intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses a few thousand times that of the sun. But there's one catch: Despite searching for them for decades, we haven't found any yet. And so a team of astronomers, writing on the preprint server arXiv.org
(opens in new tab)
, has proposed a new method to go hunting for IMBHs, using the subtle ripples in space-time caused by the black holes' motions through the center of the Milky Way.

Astronomers desperately want to find an IMBH because it will help them piece together the formation history of black holes. As far as we currently understand it, giant black holes weren't born that way. Instead, they started out as mere stellar-mass black holes. Then, over hundreds of millions of years, they wolfed down any scrap of material that wandered too close, and they also found each other and merged, rapidly ballooning into their impressive current size. That rapid growth suggests that there ought to be few IMBHs left, because that size of black hole represents only a temporary phase on a black hole's way to supermassiveness.

However, other models of black hole formation suggest that IMBHs might actually be common and just difficult to detect. The cramped conditions of the galactic core, for example, might be ripe to produce potentially thousands of large-but-not-supermassive black holes. But those IMBHs might be hidden, as the supermassive black hole in the very center of the galaxy would dominate our observations.

To tease these possibilities out, the authors of the new study hope to use  the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a planned gravitational wave detector that the European Space Agency hopes to launch in 2037. The observatory will detect gravitational waves, which are subtle ripples in space-time first predicted by Einstein, as they wash through the solar system. Similar ground-based observatories like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo have already had tremendous success in detecting mergers of stellar-mass black holes, but those instruments are not sensitive to the frequencies needed to detect signals from anything larger.

—Black holes may be swallowing invisible matter that slows the movement of stars

—What's the biggest black hole in the universe?

LISA will consist of a trio of satellites orbiting the sun that will constantly monitor the distances among them. When a gravitational wave comes by, the satellites will detect the telltale signature, like buoys in the ocean recognizing a passing tidal wave.

To search for IMBHs, the astronomers have to hope for a lucky break. If an IMBH in the galactic center happens to capture a wandering dense remnant (like a smaller black hole, a neutron star, or a white dwarf), the process will emit gravitational waves that LISA can potentially detect. Because the IMBH itself will be orbiting around the central supermassive black hole, these gravitational waves will undergo a Doppler shift (like the shifting in frequencies from a passing ambulance) due to the IMBH's motion.

If enough IMBHs lurk in our galactic core, then these silent acts of destruction may leave delicate signatures in gravitational waves. The proposed method is far from complete, however: LISA will only be able to detect IMBHs if they have a mass range from 1,000 to 100,000 solar masses. It's a longshot to be sure, but it just might work.

The results show that the mini flares are an excellent proxy for studying the real things.","A close up of an artificial plasma loop collapsing into a mini solar flare. (Image credit: Bellan Lab/Caltech)

Solar flares are enormous plumes of superheated plasma ejected by the sun. These massive plumes are so large, they could engulf our planet several times over. But for the first time, researchers have created mini solar flares in a laboratory that are small enough to fit inside your lunchbox.

Solar flares are birthed from large loops of plasma, or ionized gas, on the sun’s surface. These loops, known as corona loops, form along invisible magnetic field lines that get twisted by the sun's intense gravity. Sometimes, however, these lines snap back into their original shape like a rubber band, which flings plasma away from the sun.

Solar flares can also launch coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — fast-moving clouds of magnetized plasma, high-energy particles and electromagnetic radiation — that can trigger disruptive geomagnetic storms if they hit Earth. But despite observing hundreds of solar flares, researchers still don't know how they transition from corona loops into full-blown projectiles.

In a new study, published April 6 in the journal Nature Astronomy
(opens in new tab)
, a team of researchers from California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena created their own artificial corona loops in the lab to try and solve this mystery.

Related: 1 million-mile-long plasma plume shoots out of the sun in stunning photo

The team discharged electricity from a pair of electrodes inside a magnetized, gas-filled chamber. The electricity ionized the gas, creating a string of plasma between the two electrodes, which was then briefly held in place as a loop by the chamber's magnetic field before collapsing and firing a mini flare outward.  

The loops were around 8 inches (20 centimeters) long, around the same size as a banana, and lasted for around 10 microseconds, during which the experiment used up the same amount of energy as the city of Pasadena does in the same timeframe. Using specialized cameras that capture 10 million frames per second, the researchers watched how the loops grew and then broke apart.

The study confirmed that the artificial loops looked like ropes, just as other researchers had previously proposed.

""If you dissect a piece of rope, you see that it's made up of braids of individual strands. Pull those individual strands apart, and you'll see that they're braids of even smaller strands, and so on,"" study lead author Yang Zhang
(opens in new tab)
, a graduate student at Caltech, said in a statement
(opens in new tab)
. ""Plasma loops appear to work the same way."" 

This rope-like structure may play a key role in the birth of solar flares. In the lab, the artificial loops remained stable until they were overloaded with energy, at which point a corkscrew-shaped kink appeared in the loops, and they broke apart. The video footage reveals that the kink initially caused one strand of plasma to snap, which then put additional strain on the surrounding strands, causing them to snap as well. 

RELATED STORIES

—Mysterious 'sparks' on the sun could help scientists predict solar flares

—China's $1 trillion 'artificial sun' fusion reactor just got five times hotter than the sun

—Puzzle of the sun's mysterious 'heartbeat' signals finally solved

Similar kinks also appear in images of real corona loops before they break down into solar flares, the researchers wrote.

During the moment the loops snap, the researchers also detected a voltage spike. They believe that a similar spike in real solar flares could provide the necessary energy to launch the high-energy particles and radiation in a CME. 

This is not the first time that scientists have attempted to replicate the sun in a laboratory setting. In January, researchers at UCLA unveiled an artificial ""mini sun"" that can generate sound waves to mimic the effects of gravity. The plasma-filled glass sphere, which is just 1 inch (3 cm) across, could also be used to study how the sun's magnetic fields influence solar flares.

Archaeologists are baffled but excited by the discovery of two silver coins from the Roman Empire on a remote island in the Baltic Sea, halfway between Sweden and Estonia. 

No clues reveal how the coins got there, but they may have been left by Norse traders, lost in a shipwreck or brought there on a Roman ship that voyaged to the far north.

Johan Rönnby
(opens in new tab)
, an archaeologist at Södertörn University in Stockholm, was part of the team that found the coins with metal detectors in March, at a beach site marked by old fireplaces on the island of Gotska Sandön.

""We were so happy,"" he told Live Science. ""We have this site, but we don't know what it is. But now that we have the coins there, it makes it even more interesting to continue to excavate it.""

Roman coins

The two silver coins found on the island are both Roman ""denarii"" — one from the reign of the emperor Trajan, between A.D. 98 and 117, and the other from the reign of the emperor Antoninus Pius, between A.D. 138 and 161.

They each weigh less than an eighth of an ounce (4 grams) and would have represented about a day's pay for a laborer when they were minted. 

Denarii were the standard coin of ancient Rome, and their name survives today in the word for ""money"" in several Latin-based languages, such as ""denaro"" in Italian and ""dinero"" in Spanish.

Rönnby said coins from the Roman Empire could have stayed in circulation for a long time, because the silver they contained always remained valuable; and they might have been brought to Gotska Sandön by Norse traders who had taken shelter there from storms at sea.

—Pot brimming with Roman coins discovered in Switzerland

But it's also possible they were carried there by survivors from a shipwreck: The waters around the island are notoriously dangerous, and the area is littered with wrecks, he said.

Another possibility is that the coins were taken to Gotska Sandön by Romans on a Roman ship, though no records of such a voyage into the Baltic exist.

""It's not likely to be a Roman ship,"" Rönnby said. ""But you have to consider also that the Romans were sailing up to Scotland and so on, and that there were Roman authors at that time writing about the Baltic area.""

Baltic island

Roman coins have also been found on the larger island of Gotland about 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the south, but that was perhaps to be expected because it was the location of several towns. Gotska Sandön, however, has no towns or villages.

Gotska Sandön — meaning ""Sand Island"" — is uninhabited today but was home to lighthouse keepers in the 19th century. Before that it was known as a place of shipwrecks and as a haunt for pirates, Rönnby said.

Archaeologist Daniel Langhammer
(opens in new tab)
, who oversees cultural heritage on Gotska Sandön for Gotland County, told Live Science that the new finds echoed claims by a 19th-century lighthouse keeper that he'd found a Roman coin on the island. 

But the mystery of how the coins arrived might never be solved, he said. ""We just don't know how they got there.""

The remote island was also once frequented by seal hunters — seal hunting is now forbidden, but the seals are still there — and by fishers during the summer months, he said.

Rönnby and his colleagues, including Sabine Sten, an osteologist at Uppsala University, will return to the site later this year. They hope eventually to reconstruct the history of the remote island.

More than 2.5 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis were reported in the U.S. in 2021 — nearly 6% more than were reported in 2020. 

Syphilis rates, in particular, leapt to levels not seen since the 1950s
(opens in new tab)
. More than 176,000 cases of syphilis were reported in 2021, up from nearly 134,000 in 2020. Rates of the bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) reached historic lows in the early 2000s — when they hovered around 30,000 per year — but they have climbed steadily since then, according to finalized data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(opens in new tab)
 (CDC) on Tuesday (April 11).

Out of the total reported syphilis cases, 2,855 were congenital syphilis, which occurs when syphilis-causing bacteria pass through the placenta during pregnancy. These cases resulted in 220 congenital syphilis-related stillbirths and infant deaths. Overall, the nationwide rate of congenital syphilis increased more than 30% between 2020 and 2021. Rates of the disease are 464% higher than they were in 2001.

The resurgence of syphilis in the U.S. ""remains a significant source of concern,"" Dr. Leandro Mena
(opens in new tab)
, director of CDC's Division of STD Prevention, wrote in the report

. However, the 2021 rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea far outpaced those for syphilis.

More than 1.6 million cases of chlamydia were reported in 2021, making the STI the most commonly reported of the three. Chlamydia rates were up about 4% from 2020, signaling a shift towards pre-pandemic levels but not a full rebound. (Case rates dipped from 2019 to 2020, likely due to a decrease in screening related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chlamydia is often asymptomatic and so cases may go uncounted when screening falters, the CDC report states.)

More than 710,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported in 2021, an increase of 4.6% from 2020. Since hitting a historic low in 2009, gonorrhea rates have increased by 118%.

It's estimated that about half of the 2021 infections showed resistance to at least one antibiotic drug, but nearly all circulating gonorrhea strains in the U.S. remain vulnerable to ceftriaxone, the recommended treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Massachusetts health officials recently identified a ""concerning"" gonorrhea strain with ""reduced susceptibility"" to ceftriaxone, but even that strain could be killed with high doses of the drug. The CDC says

 it's only a matter of time before a strain becomes fully resistant to available treatments.

""The U.S. STI epidemic shows no signs of slowing,"" Mena said in the report. ""The reasons for the ongoing increases are multifaceted — and so are the solutions."" 

Why are sexually transmitted infections on the rise in the US? A perfect storm of factors, including pandemic-related disruptions, a reduced public health focus on sexual health, increased opioid use and changes in sexual behavior, such as decreased condom use.

Wild elephants may have domesticated themselves, a process that has only been previously identified in bonobos and humans, a new study suggests. 

For thousands of years, people have domesticated, or bred other animals such as dogs and horses to enhance their friendliness, reduce aggression and increase cooperation. Some scientists think a similar phenomenon called self-domestication has given humans and bonobos (Pan paniscus) traits commonly found in domestic animals. During self-domestication, individuals who are less aggressive and more cooperative are more likely to successfully breed and pass on their genes. However, experts told Live Science that the underlying idea of ""self-domestication"" doesn't really hold water.

In the new study, Limor Raviv
(opens in new tab)
, who studies the evolution of languages at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, and her colleagues suggest that elephants have also domesticated themselves. The findings were published Apr. 3 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

The scientists compared wild African elephants from the species Loxodonta africana with bonobos and humans on 19 social, cognitive and physical traits. The researchers found that elephants, like bonobos and humans, are not very aggressive, play a lot, have a long childhood — reaching adolescence at 10 to 20 years old — and babysit each other's offspring. They also found that elephants, like bonobos and humans, have relatively short jawbones, a trait commonly seen in other domesticated animals and which is thought to be a byproduct of selecting for other traits during domestication.

By comparing the genome of wild African savannah elephants with those of 261 domesticated mammals such as dogs, cats and horses, the scientists identified 79 genes linked to domestication in other species that seem to have become more common in elephant generations over time.

The findings suggest that elephants have been self-domesticated, the scientists wrote in their paper. One factor driving this self-domestication could be the ""massive size and relative strength"" of elephants, because they are ""less worried about evading or fighting other animals for their survival,"" the researchers wrote in their paper. This could allow the gentle giants to ""free cognitive resources and open up opportunities for exploration, communication, and play,"" the team wrote.

But other experts aren't sold on the concept.

""It's a fun idea but I'm certainly not convinced by self-domestication as a concept,"" Dominic Wright
(opens in new tab)
, an evolutionary biologist who studies domestication at Linköping University in Sweden, told Live Science. ""I certainly agree that humans have evolved to have increased sociality and increased communication but I don't think you need to bring in this term of self-domestication for humans or elephants.""  The term is unnecessary as it doesn’t help us understand how animal domestication or evolution of social behavior occurs, Wright said.

What's more, the genetic evidence in the study is weak, said Wright, who was not involved in the research.

""They link genes in elephants with genetic pathways thought to be involved in the domestication of other animals but that doesn't really tell us if those genes actually contribute to them having traits associated with domestication, they may have any other function.""

""I would personally not use the concept of self-domestication, but that's more like a semantic issue,"" Per Jensen
(opens in new tab)
, a geneticist studying animal domestication at Linköping University in Sweden, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science. 

Still, the study presents an ""interesting idea"" that helps ""trigger new thoughts on how increased cooperativeness and reduced aggression has evolved,"" which could ultimately help us find ways to reduce aggression in humans, Jensen said.
